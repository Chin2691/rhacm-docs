= Access control and cluster credentials

You can create and rotate your cluster credentials. A _credential_ is required to create a {ocp} cluster on a cloud service provider with {product-title}. The credential stores the access information for a cloud provider. Each provider account requires its own credential, as does each domain on a single provider.

**Required access**: Cluster administrator
