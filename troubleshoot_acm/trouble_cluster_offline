= Troubleshooting an offline cluster

There are a few common causes for a cluster showing an offline status. 

[#symptom-cluster-offline]
== Symptom: Cluster status is offline

After you complete the procedure for creating a cluster, you cannot access it from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management console, and it shows a status of `offline`.

[#resolving-cluster-offline]
== Resolving the problem:

. Determine if the managed cluster is available. You can check this in the _Clusters_ area of the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management console. 

If it is not available, try rerestarting the managed cluster.

. Look for network or connectivity issues in the log of the `endpoint-connmgr` pod. 

If there are errors for connectivity problems, fix the connectivity issues and restart the `endpoint-connmgr` pod.

. Verify that the `klusterlet` is working correctly by checking the log for the `endpoint-workmgr` pod.

If the `klusterlet` is not working correctly, restart the `endpoint-workmgr` pod.
