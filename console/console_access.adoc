[#accessing-your-console]
= Accessing your console

The {product-title} web console is integrated with the {ocp} web console as a console plug-in. You can access {product-title-short} within the {ocp-short} console from the cluster switcher by selecting *All Clusters*. The cluster switcher is a drop-down menu that initially displays `local-cluster`.

Select `local-cluster` when you want to use {ocp-short} console features on the cluster where you installed {product-title-short}. Select *All Clusters* when you want to use {product-title-short} features to manage your fleet of clusters.

If the cluster switcher is not present, the required console plug-ins might not be enabled. For new installations, the console plug-ins are enabled by default. If you upgraded from a previous version of {product-title-short} and want to enable the plug-ins, or if you want to disable the plug-ins, see <<ocp-plug-ins,{ocp-short} console plug-ins>>:

For additional options to access your console, see the following topics:

[#from-the-red-hat-openshift-cli]
== From the Red Hat OpenShift CLI:

. While logged in to {ocp} and after you install {product-title}, run the following command to find the route.
In this example, `namespace-from-install` is the namespace where you installed the product:

----
oc get routes -n <namespace-from-install>
----

. Find the `open-cluster-management` name and the `Host/Port` columns to get your URL.
