= Assign a placement rule

You can assign a placement rule to a deployable or subscription.
To assign a placement rule, you need to update the spec for the deployable or subscription to reference the placement rule.

Include the following `placement` fields in your deployable or subscription spec with the values to reference the placement rule:

----
placement:
  placementRef:
    name:
    kind: PlacementRule
----

Include the name of your placement rule as the value for the `name` field.

When a placement rule is assigned to a subscription, you can view the assignment on the Applications dashboard within the console with the following procedure:

. Open the console.
. From the Navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.
The *Overview* tab for all applications opens.
. Click the *Resources* tab.
. Scroll to the *Resource pipeline* section.
Within the table that lists your applications, expand the row for the application that includes the subscription that is assigned the placement rule.
. From the expanded view for the application, you can see the available subscriptions for each channel.
The details for each subscription include any assigned placement rule.
If needed, you can select to view or edit the YAML for the placement rule, subscription, and channel from this resource pipeline table.
