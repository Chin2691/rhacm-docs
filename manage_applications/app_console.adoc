[#application-console]
= Application console

The console includes a dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage applications resources, and view the status of your applications. Enhanced capabilities help your developers and operations personnel create, deploy, update, manage, and visualize applications across your clusters.

See the following application console capabilities:

* Visualize deployed applications across your clusters, including any associated channels and subscriptions.

* Access a topology view that encompasses the new application resource definitions, including channels, subscriptions, placement rules, and Ansible Tower jobs.

* View individual status in the context of an application, including deployments, updates, and subscriptions.

* Add and edit channels, subscriptions, placement rules, and applications.

The console includes different tools that each provide different application management capabilities. These capabilities allow you to easily create, find, update, and deploy applications resources.

[#applications-overview]
== Applications overview

From the main _Overview_ tab, see the following:


* A table that lists all applications
* The _Find resources_ box to filter the applications that are listed
* The application name and namespace
* The remote and local clusters where resources are deployed through a subscription
* The date when the application was created
* A Time window constraint, if any were added
* More actions, such as *Delete application*.

Click on an application name in the table to view an overview about a single application. The overview displays the following information:

* Cluster details, such as resource status.
* Subscription details
* Resource topology

[#resource-topology]
== Resource topology

The topology provides a visual representation of all the applications and resources within a project, their build status, and the components and services associated with them.

* You can select any component from the topology view to view more details.

* View the details for a pod by clicking on the nodes to open the properties view.

* View cluster CPU and memory. 
+
**Note:** The cluster CPU and memory percentage that is displayed is the percentage that is currently utilized. This value is rounded down, so a very small value might display as `0`.
+

*  View a successful Ansible Tower deployment. Additionally, you can see errors if your Ansible Tower deployment is not successful.

* Click *Launch resource in Search* to search for related clusters.

[#search]
== Search

The console _Search_ page supports searching for application resources by the component `kind` for each resource. To search for resources, use the following values:

|===
| Application resource | Kind (search parameter)

| Subscription
| `Subscription`

| Channel
| `Channel`

| Secret
| `Secret`

| Placement rule
| `PlacementRule`

| Application
| `Application`

|===

You can also search by other fields, including name, namespace, cluster, label, and more.

From the search results, you can view identifying details for each resource, including the name, namespace, cluster, labels, and creation date.

If needed, you can also expand *Actions* menu in the search results for a resource to select to delete that resource.

Click the resource name in the search results to open the YAML editor. Any changes that you save are applied to the resource immediately.

For more information about using search, see link:../console/search.adoc#search-in-the-console[Search in the console].


[#Advanced-configuration]
== Advanced configuration

Click the *Advanced configuration* to view the summary of resources for all applications on different cards. These resource summary cards show the following information about your applications and related managed clusters:


You can click each summary card to open the _Search_ page and display more information about the selected resource.

* From this page, you can also click the multiple **Actions** to edit or delete channels. 

When you select to create any of these resources a YAML editor opens for you to use to define the resource. Default sample YAML content is included as templates to indicate the required fields to help you create any of these resource types.
