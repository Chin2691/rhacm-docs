[#subscribing-git-resources]
== Subscribing Git resources 

You can subscribe Git resources to multiple namespaces. To apply these resources in the specific namespaces other than the subscription namespace, see the following procedure.

By default, when you subscribe to an application, the application is deployed into the subscription namespace. Complete the following procedure to change the defaul behavior and include other namespaces:

Required access: Administrator 

. From the console, log in to your hub cluster.

. Create one or more users. 

+
These users represent administrators for the `app.open-cluster-management.io/subscription`. With OpenShift Container Platform, you can group these users to represent a subscription administrative group.

. From the terminal, log in to your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster.

. Add the following subjects into `open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding with the following command:

----
oc edit clusterrolebinding open-cluster-management:subscription-admin
----

`open-cluster-management:subscription-admin` ClusterRoleBinding has no subject initially.

Your subjects might display as the following example:
+
----
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: example-name
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: example-group-name
----

See the following example, where you are logged in as a subscription administrator.

In the example, you subscribe the following sample resource YAML file from a Git repository.

See the following configmap settings:

* Configmap `test-configmap-1` gets created in `multins` namespace 

* Configmap `test-configmap-2` gets created in 'default'namespace

* Configmap `test-configmap-3` gets created in the subscription's namespace.


See the YAML file:

----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: multins
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-1
  namespace: multins
data:
  path: resource1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap-2
  namespace: default

  path: resource2
