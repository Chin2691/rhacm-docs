= Configuring managed clusters for Argo CD

You can manually sync any type of supported managed cluster to enable Argo CD cluster collection so that you can deploy applications from Argo CD to your ACM managed cluster.


[#prerequisites-argo]
== Prerequisites 

* You need to install Argo CD on your ACM hub cluster. (https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd)

* You need one or more managed cluster.


[#configure-argo]
== Configuring Argo CD 



. You can enable or disable the ArgoCD cluster collection for one managed cluster. See the following sample with the setting in `KlusterletAddonConfig` resource for each managed cluster:

//I think we need to go more into why disable and why enable here

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster1
  namespace: cluster1
spec:
  applicationManager:
    argocdCluster: true or false (the setting is located here to enable/disable the Argo CD cluster collection for managed cluster cluster1)
    enabled: true
----

By default, the managed cluster secret is auto-created into the hub cluster namespace by the managed cluster token cluster. See the following example, where the cluster secret is in the `local-cluster` name:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: local-cluster-cluster-secret
  namespace: local-cluster
  labels:
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/secret-type: acm-cluster
type: Opaque
stringData:
  name: local-cluster
  server: https://<url-name-here>
  config: |
    {
      "bearerToken": "<the bear token>",
      "tlsClientConfig": {
        "insecure": true
      }
    }
----

When the managed cluster secret is synced up to the Argo CD namespace, the cluster secret resembles the following sample:
//what is the user looking for here, do they need to do anything here.

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster
    apps.open-cluster-management.io/acm-cluster: "true"
  name: old-cluster1-cluster-secret
  namespace: argocd
type: Opaque
stringData:
  name: cluster1
  server: https://<url-name-here>
  config: |
    {
      "bearerToken": "<bearer token>",
      "tlsClientConfig": {
        "insecure": true
      }
    }
