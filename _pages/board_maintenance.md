# Board maintance

# New issues: 

  - Unassigned and untriaged until acknowledged
  - Label properly (dev label if release work)
  - Ask for more information if it is needed
  - If there is not sufficient info, label doc:awaiting input
  - DDF assigned to one person automatically, untriaged until acknowledged by focal
  
# Existing issues:

  - We have to keep up with existing issues; no issues should be 8 months old, for instance.
  - If not release work or customer reported, ask if still valid.
  - If enhancement or an addition requested internally, it may be suitable for the next release.
  
# Milestones and columns

  - Future milestone can go into product
  - Doc issues must be placed a minimum of 2 sprints ahead of the related dev issue. For example, if the dev issue is placed in _Sprint 1_, then the doc issue is to be placed in the _Sprint 3_ milestone.
