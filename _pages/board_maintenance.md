# Board maintenance

# New issues: 

  - Unassigned and untriaged until acknowledged within a day or so
  - Label properly (dev label if release work or cross squad issue)
  - Ask for more information if it is needed (use comments)
  - If there is not sufficient info, label `doc:awaiting input`
  - DDF assigned to one person automatically, leave untriaged until acknowledged by a focal
  
# Existing issues:

  - We have to keep up with existing issues; no issues should be 8 months old, for instance.
  - If not release work or customer reported, ask if still valid.
  - If enhancement or an addition requested internally, it may be suitable for the next release.
  
# Milestones and columns used for sprint planning

  - Future milestone can go into product column
  - Doc issues must be placed a minimum of 2 sprints ahead of the related dev issue. For example, if the dev issue is placed in _Sprint 1_, then the doc issue is to be placed in the _Sprint 3_ milestone. 
  - Use meetings to plan for the sprint and update the team on progress.
  - Bring up any unplanned work that got in the way on progress.


# Board review in scrums:

  - Board focal looks at each assignees board for balance of issues
  - Scan for old or duplicate issues
  - Prioritize issues if needed
  - Assign any unassigned issues
  - Check for issues sitting in verificication (what is needed to close them?)

# Milestones

  - To avoid all doc work going into 2.3 and not spread out across sprints, use sprint milestones for release work that is tied to a dev issue.
  - Use refresh labels for valid refresh changes.
  - Blogs can go into a release milestone, for example, `2.3`. Please also label `blog`.
  - DDF items are often requests from Red Hatters for enhancements to the product. These are treated as RFEs via the Jira process. 
  - DDF items are also often requests for doc enhancements. Label them enhancements, not bugs. Get with developers to see what changes make sense, if any.
  - DDF items are also not opened in the proper milestone. Please change before you move from `untriage`.
