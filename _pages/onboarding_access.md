Before starting at Red Hat, you need to set up VPN access to the Red Hat environment, create required passwords to access Red Hats tools, and understand information security expectations regarding the use of your non-Red Hat device to access Red Hat tools.

## Red Hat Environment Overview

Most of our shared service applications (email, support portal) are available via the public network. To access these applications you will just need your Red Hat credentials. Other applications like software development tools and financial applications require you to access the Red Hat private network first before you can enter your Red Hat credentials to gain access.

Become familiar with the following terms before proceeding:

**VPN:** A secure connection accessed by two-factor authentication that allows
users to interface with internal Red Hat systems.

**Kerberos:** One of our network authentication protocols
used at Red Hat. Kerberos authentication is widely used to access engineering
environments. It is also used to establish your two-factor PIN + token.

**PIN + token:** Two-factor authentication password for accessing the majority of
our business applications.

## Prerequisites

Red Hat requires that all devices accessing Red Hat resources meet the following
requirements before accessing our network and tools:

- Your device storage must employ encryption
- The system must have up to date antivirus
- The system must be up to date on software and operating system patches

After ensuring your device meets the security requirements, contact your
manager to get your Red Hat credentials. This includes your username and a
temporary token code that will give you to access our systems to set up your
permanent passwords and authentication tokens.

Your username is sometimes referred to as a Kerberos ID. Use the username provided
by your manager in the _username_ field as shown in the following image:

The password for SSO is referred to as PIN + token at Red Hat. Use the temporary token provided by your manager in the _password_ field until you have successfully ceated a PIN + token. Additionally, any prompt asking for a PIN + token will require the temporary token. Temporary tokens expire after five days.
