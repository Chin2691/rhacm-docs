[#observing-environments]
= Observing environments

You can use {product-title} to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters. Enable the observability service operator, `multicluster-observability-operator`, to monitor the health of your managed clusters. Learn about the architecture for the multicluster observability service in the following sections.

[#observability-service]
== Observability service

By default, observability is included with the product installation, but not enabled. Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. {product-title-short} supports the following stable object stores:

- Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible object stores like Ceph)
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure storage
- OpenShift Container Storage

When the service is enabled, the `observability-endpoint-controller` is automatically deployed to each imported or created cluster. This controller collects the data from {ocp} Prometheus, then sends it to the {product-title-short} hub cluster. 

When observability is enabled in a hub cluster, metrics are collected by handling the hub cluster as a managed cluster called `local-cluster`.
  
*Note*: In {product-title-short} the `metrics-collector` is only supported for {ocp} 4.x clusters. 

The observability service deploys an instance of Prometheus AlertManager, which enables alerts to be forwarded with third-party applications. It also includes an instance of Grafana to enable data visualization via dashboards (static) or data exploration. 

You can customize the observability service by creating custom link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/[recording rules] or link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/[alerting rules].

For more information about enabling observability, see link:../observability/observability_install.adoc#enable-observability[Enable observability service].

[#metric-types]
=== Metric types

By default, {ocp-short} sends metrics to Red Hat using the Telemetry service. The following additional metrics are available with {product-title-short} and will be included with telemetry, but are _not_ displayed on the dashboard:

- The `visual_web_terminal_sessions_total` is collected on the hub cluster.
- The `acm_managed_cluster_info` is collected on each managed cluster and sent to the hub cluster.

Learn from the {ocp-short} documentation what types of metrics are collected and sent using telemetry. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html-single/support/index#about-remote-health-monitoring[Information collected by Telemetry] for information. 

[#overview-page-observe]
=== Observe environments Overview page

You can view the following information about your clusters on the _Overview_ dashboard:

* Metric data from your managed clusters by selecting the Grafana link 
* Cluster, node, and pod counts across all clusters and for each provider
* Cluster status
* Cluster compliance
* Pod status

Many clickable elements on the dashboard open a search for related resources. Click on a provider card to view information for clusters from a single provider.
