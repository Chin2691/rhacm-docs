[#access-control]
= Access control and cluster credentials

You must configure authentication service requirements for {product-title} to onboard workloads to Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information see, _Understanding authentication_ in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/understanding-authentication.html[Understanding authentication] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

You can also create and rotate your credentials. A _credential_ is required to create a {ocp} cluster on a cloud service provider with {product-title}. The credential stores the access credentials and configuration information for a cloud provider. Each provider account requires its own credential, as does each domain on a single provider.

Authentication identifies the user associated roles and credentials to cloud providers. The following files detail the information that is required for creating a connection document for each supported provider:

**Required access**: Cluster administrator
