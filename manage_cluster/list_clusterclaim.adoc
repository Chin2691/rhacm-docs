[#list-clusterclaims]
= List existing ClusterClaims

You can use the `kubectl` command to list the ClusterClaims that apply to your managed cluster. This is helpful when you want to compare your ClusterClaim to an error message. 

*Note:* Make sure you have `list` permission on resource `clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io`.

Run the following command to list all existing ClusterClaims that are on the managed cluster:

----
kubectl get clusterclaims.cluster.open-cluster-management.io
----
