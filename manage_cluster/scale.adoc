= Resizing a cluster

You can customize your {ocp} managed cluster specifications by using the scaling procedures, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html/scalability_and_performance/recommended-cluster-scaling-practices[Recommended cluster scaling practices] for the {ocp-short} version of your cluster for information about resizing your cluster.

*Tip:* If you created the cluster by using the {product-title} console, then it is an {ocp-short} cluster.
