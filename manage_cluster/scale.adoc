[#resizing-a-cluster]
= Resizing a cluster

You can customize your {ocp} managed cluster specifications by using the scaling procedures, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/scalability_and_performance/recommended-cluster-scaling-practices[Recommended cluster scaling practices] in the {ocp-short} documentation for information about resizing your cluster.

*Tip:* If you created the cluster by using the {product-title-short} console, then it is an {ocp-short} cluster.

**Notes:**

* If you are changing the number of nodes of an Amazon EKS cluster that you imported, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html[Cluster autoscaler] for information about scaling the cluster.

* If you are changing the number of nodes of a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster that you imported, see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/resizing-a-cluster[Resizing a cluster] for information about scaling the cluster.

* If you are changing the number of nodes of an Azure Kubernetes Services cluster that you imported, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/scale-cluster[Scaling a cluster] for information about scaling the cluster.

* If you are changing the number of nodes of a VMware vSphere cluster that you imported, see https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-755AB944-F3D0-43DD-82CD-8CDDDF8674E8.html[Edit cluster settings] for information about scaling the cluster.

* If you are changing the number of nodes of a bare metal cluster that you imported, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/installing/installing-on-bare-metal#installing-bare-metal-network-customizations[Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster with network customizations] for information about scaling the cluster.

**Note:** Bare metal clusters are only supported when the hub cluster is {ocp-short} version 4.5, and later.

* If you are changing the number of nodes of an IBM Kubernetes Service cluster that you imported, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers[Adding worker nodes and zones to clusters] for information about scaling the cluster.
