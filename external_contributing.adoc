[#What-branch-am-I-on]

You are currently viewing the 2.2_stage branch, which is the _in-progress_ branch of the documentation for the 2.2 release. 

We support documentation for the current release, and the previous 2 releases (n-2). We refresh these releases weekly. If you need an update that is exclusive to a previous release, link:https://github.com/open-cluster-management/rhacm-docs/issues/new[open an issue] and propose that change.

[#How-do-I-submit-a-change]
== How do I submit a change?

Because most changes need to be reviewed by development, doc, and QE, open an issue with the suggestion and let the team make the changes after discussion. 

You can create a PR if your change is small and requires no debate, but we still need a GitHub issue opened for tracking purposes. You must fork the project and create your own branch to create a pull request. 

The documentation source is in ASCIIDoc format, and the content that is provided in PRs must conform to the ASCIIDoc requirements. You can find some guidance for authoring in ASCIIDoc in the link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax quick reference].

Note: All PRs outside of a typo fix require an issue.

Open an issue here: link:https://github.com/open-cluster-management/rhacm-docs/issues/new. Complete the template with the information that is required for your requested change. 

[#How-is-my-issue-handled]
== How is my issue handled?

Your new issue goes into the _new_ issues column on our ZenHub board, where it will be assigned to the correct writer. This is our open, doc-only board. Internal issues between development and doc are in the team's backlog and treated the same.

Once the change from your issue is accepted, reviewed, and merged into the staging docs for that release, we will let you know in the issue comments and you can close the issue.
