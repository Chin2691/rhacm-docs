[#gov-metric]
= Governance metric

The policy framework exposes metrics that show policy distribution and compliance. Use the `policy_governance_info` metric on the hub cluster to view trends and analyze any policy failures.

[#metric-overview]
== Metric overview

See the following topics for an overview of metrics.

[#metric-policy-governance-info]
=== Metric: policy_governance_info

The `policy_governance_info` is collected by {ocp-short} monitoring, and some aggregate data is collected by {product-title-short} observability, if it is enabled.

*Note:* If observability is enabled, you can enter a query for the metric from the Grafana _Explore_ page. 

When you create a policy, you are creating a _root_ policy. The framework watches for root policies as well as `PlacementRules` and `PlacementBindings`, to determine where to create _propagated_ policies in order to distribute the policy to managed clusters.
For both root and propagated policies, a metric of `0` is recorded if the policy is compliant, and `1` if it is non-compliant.

The `policy_governance_info` metric uses the following labels:

- `type`: The label values are `root` or `propagated`.
- `policy`: The name of the associated root policy.
- `policy_namespace`: The namespace on the hub cluster where the root policy was defined.
- `cluster_namespace`: The namespace for the cluster where the policy is distributed.

These labels and values enable queries that can show us many things happening in the cluster that might be difficult to track.

*Note:* If the metrics are not needed, and there are any concerns about performance or security, this feature can be disabled. Set the `DISABLE_REPORT_METRICS` environment variable to `true` in the propagator deployment. You can also add `policy_governance_info` metric to the observability allowlist as a custom metric. See link:../observability/customize_observability.adoc#adding-custom-metrics[Adding custom metrics] for more details.

[#metric-config-policies-evaluation-duration-]
=== Metric: config_policies_evaluation_duration_

The `config_policies_evaluation_duration_` histogram tracks the number of seconds it takes to process all configuration policies that are ready to be evaluated on the cluster. Use the following metrics to query the histogram:

- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_bucket`: The buckets are cumulative and represent seconds with the following possible entries: 1, 3, 9, 10.5, 15, 30, 90, 120, 300, 450, 600, and greater.
- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_count`: The count of all events.
- `config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_sum`: The sum of all values.

Use `config_policies_evaluation_duration_` to determine if the `ConfigurationPolicy` `evaluationInterval` setting needs to be changed for resource intensive policies that do not need frequent evaluation. You can also increase the concurrency at the cost of higher resource utilization on the Kubernetes API server. See xref:../config_policy_ctrl.adoc#configure-config-policy-controller[Configure the configuration policy controller] for more details.

To receive information about the time used to evaluate configuration policies, use a metric that resembles the following expression:

`rate(config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_sum[10m]) / rate (config_policies_evaluation_duration_seconds_count[10m]`

The `config-policy-controller` pod running on managed clusters in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace calculates the metric. The `config-policy-controller` does not send the metric to Observability by default.
