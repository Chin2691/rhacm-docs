= Creating a provider connection

A _provider connection_ is required to create a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a cloud service provider with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

The provider connection stores the access credentials and configuration information for a provider.
Each provider account requires its own provider connection, as does each domain on a single provider.

The following files detail the information that is required for creating a connection document for each supported provider:
