Use this section to troubleshoot issues when installing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

[#symptom-4]
=== Symptom

Installation process fails to start the `multiclusterhub-operator` after running the `start.sh` script.

[#identifying-the-problem-4]
=== Identifying the problem

The installation output shows that the installation timed out during the `Wait for multiclusterhub-operator to reach running state (4 min)` step.

[#resolving-the-problem-4]
=== Resolving the problem

The following workarounds might help resolve this issue:

* An incorrect snapshot format was entered.
The correct format is `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-2020-04-01-02-43-31`.
The previous snapshot value that was entered becomes the default value.
If it was entered incorrectly, then the correct value must be entered manually during a new installation attempt.
+
Run the installation again with the correct snapshot value to resolve this problem.

* An incorrect pull-secret was used.
Make sure you selected the _Kubernetes Secret_ when you generated the pull secret from Quay.
If it is a different format, the output displays the following error when applying the prerequisites:
+
----
Failed to read Resources YAML file [pull-secret.yaml] encounters a format error.
----
+
Repeat the steps to create your pull secret, and download the _Kubernetes Secret_ to resolve this issue.
