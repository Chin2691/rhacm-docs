= Upgrading your cluster

After you create clusters that you want to manage with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, you can upgrade those clusters to the latest version by using the console.

This method of upgrading only works for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are in a _Ready_ state.

To upgrade your cluster, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
If an upgrade is available, it is shown in the _Distribution version_ column.
. Select the clusters that you want to upgrade.
*Remember:* A cluster must be in _Ready_ state, and must be a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to be upgraded with the console.
. Select *Upgrade*.
. Select the new version of each cluster.
. Select *Upgrade*.
