[#certificate-manager-must-not-exist-during-an-installation]
== Certificate manager must not exist during an installation

When certificate manager already exists on the cluster, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installation fails.

To resolve this issue, verify if the certificate manager is present in your cluster by running the following command:

----
   kubectl get crd | grep certificates.certmanager
----

[#application-not-deployed-after-an-updated-placement-rule]
== Application not deployed after an updated placement rule

If applications are not deploying after an update to a placement rule, verify that the `endpoint-appmgr` pod is running.
The `endpoint-appmgr` is the subscription container that needs to run on endpoint clusters.

You can run `oc get pods -n multicluster-endpoint` to verify.

You can also search for `kind:pod cluster:yourcluster` in the console and see if the `endpoint-appmgr` is running.

If you cannot verify, attempt to import the cluster again and verify again.
