[#viewing-a-cis-policy-from-command-line-interface-cli]
==== Viewing a CIS policy from command line interface (CLI)

Complete the following steps to view the CIS policy from the managed cluster CLI:

. Get a list of the CIS policies that are on your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get cispolicy --all-namespaces
----

. Run the following command to view which policies are listed `NonCompliant`:
+
----
oc describe cispolicy -n <namespace> <policyname>

+
----
  Status:
    Cis Policy Status:
      Endpoint 4:
        Cluster Name:  endpoint4
        Compliancy:    NonCompliant
        Node Status:
          150 . 238 . 253 . 105:  NonCompliant
          150 . 238 . 253 . 106:  NonCompliant
          150 . 238 . 253 . 121:  NonCompliant

    Warning  Medium Risk  12s (x2 over 26s)  cis-controller  Medium Risk detected!
----

. Verify which nodes are non-compliant by running the following commands:
+
----
oc get nodes -o wide

oc describe node <node-name>
----
+
NOTE: The node name that appear might be a label for the node, for instance `ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/external-ip=150.238.253.106`.

. View the risk scores for the CIS rules in your policy by running the following command:

----
  kubectl -n <namespace> describe configmap endpoint-cisctrl-controller-config
----

[#creating-a-cis-policy-from-the-console]
=== Creating a CIS policy from the console

. Log in to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk*.
. Click *Create Policy*.
. Enter the name for the CIS policy in the *Name* field.
. For *Specifications*, select `Cispolicy-cis compliance for OCP` from the drop-down list.

NOTE: You must enable the feature flag to make the `Cispolicy-cis compliance for OCP` option available.

. Use the drop-down list and make selections for the following parameters:
 ** Cluster selector
 ** Standards
 ** Categories
 ** Controls
. Click *Create*.

A policy is created and is embedded into the policy.
View a sample of the CIS policy, see _CIS policy sample_ from xref:cis-policy-controller[CIS policy controller].

[#viewing-a-cis-policy-from-the-console]
==== Viewing a CIS policy from the console

View any CIS Policy and its status from the console.

. Log in to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.
. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.

NOTE: You can filter the table list of your policies by selecting the _All policies_ tab or _Cluster violations_ tab.

. Select one of your policies.

[#enabling-the-cis-policy-controller-from-the-cli]
=== Enabling the CIS policy controller from the CLI

The CIS policy controller monitors the nodes in a cluster for compliance against CIS Kubernetes benchmark checks.
The CIS policies that list the rules to exclude can be applied to the managed clusters.
The controller checks the cluster for any violations that are not in the exclude list.

When you install the Klusterlet, the CIS policy controller is disabled by default.
Enable the controller after your cluster is imported by running the following command:

----
  kubectl patch endpointconfig $CLUSTER_NAME -n $CLUSTER_NAMESPACE --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/cisController/enabled", "value":true}]'
----

[#enabling-the-cis-policy-controller-from-the-console]
=== Enabling the CIS policy controller from the console

Complete the following steps to enable the CIS policy controller feature flag from the console.
The CIS policy specification becomes available:

. Log in to your hub cluster and open the Visual Web terminal.
. Edit the deployment to enable the feature flag.
Run the following command:
+
----
oc edit deployment $(oc get deployment -o custom-columns=:.metadata.name | grep 'grcui$')
----

. Update the `env.value` parameter to `"yes"`.
Your deployment might resemble the following content:
+
----
-env
  - name: featureFlags_cisPolicyTemplate
    value: "yes"
----

. Save your deployment and close the Visual Web Terminal.
. The associated pod restarts.
Attempt to create the policy again.

[#remediating-cis-policy-violation]
== Remediating CIS policy violation

Verify rule failures to remediate your CIS policy violations.
Complete the following steps:

. Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform from the CLI.
Run the following command to port-forward the CIS controller MinIO endpoint:
+
----
oc port-forward endpoint-cisctrl-minio-0 9123:9000
----

. Log in to your MinIO account with your access key and secret key, which is contained on the endpoint in a secret.
Obtain the endpoint secret by running the following command:

----
  oc get secret -n multicluster-endpoint endpoint-cisctrl-secret -o yaml
----

. Decode the encoded values by completing the following steps:
. Decode the access key and secret key by running the following commands:
+
----
echo <encoded_access_key_value> | base64 --decode

echo <encoded_secret_key_value> | base64 --decode
----

. Copy and paste the decoded values into the appropriate fields from the MinIO console.
. Verify what nodes are labeled `NonCompliant`.
From the MinIO menu browser, select *cis-k8s* > *icp-local* > *recent* > *IP address for worker or master node*.
. Click the non-compliant node and select the attached file to download.
Click *Download object* and then open the file.
The nodes rules that have failed are shown with the following label: `[FAIL]`.
. Remediate the non-compliant node manually by referencing the `Remediation` section of the attached file.
If a rule does not apply to your environment, add the rule to the `masterNodeExcludeRules` or `workerNodeExcludeRules` in your CIS policy.
Your `Remediation` section might resemble the following content:
+
----
== Remediations ==
7.9 Reset to the OpenShift defaults

7.12 Reset to the OpenShift default values.

7.14 Edit the Openshift node config file /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml and set RotateKubeletClientCertificate to true.

7.15 Edit the Openshift node config file /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml and set RotateKubeletServerCertificate to true.

8.2
8.3 Run the below command on each worker node.
chmod 644 $nodesvc

8.4 audit test did not run: failed to run: stat -c %U:%G $nodesvc, command: [stat -c %U:%G $nodesvc], error: exit status 1

[#deleting-a-cis-poicy]
=== Deleting a CIS poicy

Delete a CIS policy from the CLI or the console.

* Delete a CIS policy from the CLI:
 .. Delete a CIS policy by running the following command:

+
----
  kubectl delete policy <cis-policy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
+
After your policy is deleted, it is removed from your target cluster or clusters.
 .. Verify that your policy is removed by running the following command:

+
----
  kubectl get policy <policy-name> -n <mcm namespace>
----
* Delete a policy from the console:
 .. From the navigation menu, click *Govern risk* to view a table list of your policies.
 .. Click the *Options* icon for the policy you want to delete in the policy violation table.
 .. Click *Remove*.
 .. From the _Remove policy_ dialog box, click *Remove policy*.

Your policy is deleted.
