[#uninstalling]
= Uninstalling

When you uninstall Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, you must delete both the MultiClusterHub Instance and the `multiclusterhub-operator`.
You can do that by using scripts, or by using commands.

There are scripts that are provided in the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/deploy[`open-cluster-management/deploy` GitHub repository] that simplify the procedures.

== Deleting both components by using script files

. Run the `uninstall.sh` script file that is in the root directory of the https://github.com/open-cluster-management/deploy[`open-cluster-management/deploy` GitHub repository] to remove the MultiClusterHub instance.
To run this script file, run the following command in the root directory of the cloned repository:

----
./uninstall.sh
----

. To remove the `multiclusterhub-operator`, any Hive deployments, and detach all imported clusters, run the `clean-clusters.sh` script file by entering the following command:

----
./clean-clusters.sh
----

. Enter `DESTROY` to delete any Hive deployments and detach all imported clusters.
. Run the `unistall.sh` script again by entering the following command:

----
./uninstall.sh
----
