== Identifying the problem: Cluster with pending import status

. Run the following command on the managed cluster to view the Kubernetes pod name that is having the issue:

----
  kubectl get pod -n multicluster-endpoint | grep connmgr
----

. Run the following command on the managed cluster to find the log entry for the error:

----
  kubectl logs <connmgr_pod>
----

Replace +++<connmgr_pod>+++with the pod name that you identified in step 1.+++</connmgr_pod>+++

. Search the returned results for text that indicates there was a networking connectivity problem.
Examples include: `no route to host` or `unable to resolve`.

[#resolving-the-problem-cluster-with-pending-import-status]
== Resolving the problem: Cluster with pending import status

. Retrieve the port number that is having the problem by entering the following command on the hub cluster:

----
  oc get infrastructure cluster -o yaml | grep apiServerURL
----

. Ensure that the hostname from the managed cluster can be resolved, and that outbound connectivity to the host and port is occurring.

If the communication cannot be established by the managed cluster, the cluster import is not complete.
The cluster status for the managed cluster is _Pending import_.
