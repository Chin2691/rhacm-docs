[#creating-a-provider-connection-for-microsoft-azure]
= Creating a provider connection for Microsoft Azure

You need a provider connection to use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console to create and manage a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Microsoft Azure.

NOTE: This procedure is a prerequisite for creating a cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You must have the following prerequisites before creating a provider connection:

* A deployed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster
* Internet access for your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes hub cluster so that it can create the Kubernetes cluster on Azure
* Account permissions that allow installing on Azure.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-configure-portal[How to configure a cloud service] for more information.
* Azure login credentials, which include your Base Domain Resource Group and Azure Service Principal JSON.
See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/azure-portal[azure.microsoft.com].

[#creating-a-provider-connection-by-using-the-console]
== Creating a provider connection by using the console

To create a provider connection from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console, complete the following steps:

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. On the _Clusters_ page, select the _Provider connections_ tab.

Existing provider connections are displayed.

. Select *Add a connection*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* as your provider.
. Add a name for your provider connection.
. Select a namespace for your provider connection from the list.

TIP: You can create a namespace specifically to host your provider connections, both for convenience and added security.

. Add your _Base Domain Resource Group Name_ for your Azure account.
This is the resource name that you created with your Azure account.
You can determine this by entering: `cat ~/.azure/osServicePrincipal`.
. Add your _Azure Service Principal JSON_.
. Enter your _Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret_.
You can download your pull secret from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshiinstall/pull-secret[Pull secret].
. Add your _SSH Private Key_ and _SSH Public Key_ to use to connect to the cluster.
See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-default.html[Generating an SSH private key and adding it to the agent] for more information about how to generate a key.
. Click *Create*.
When you create the provider connection, it is added to the list of provider connections.

You can create a cluster that uses this provider connection by completing the steps in link:create_azure.html[Creating a cluster on Microsoft Azure].

[#deleting-your-provider-connection]
== Deleting your provider connection

When you are no longer managing a cluster that is using a provider connection, delete the provider connection to protect the information in the provider connection.

. From the navigation menu, navigate to *Automate infrastructure* > *Clusters*.
. Select *Provider connections*.
. Select the options menu for the provider connection that you want to delete.
. Select *Delete connection*.
