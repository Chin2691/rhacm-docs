[#managing-policies]
= Managing policies

Create and maintain deployment policies.
Deployment policies automatically scale the number of deployment replicas.

The CPU usage of deployments drives replica scaling in a cluster.

[#automatic-scale-up]
== Automatic scale up

A scale up is triggered during increased CPU demand, such as when a server experiences high levels of requests.
The following condition automatically triggers a scale up operation:

----
CURRENT_CPU_UT >1.1*TARGET_CPU_UT
----

When a deployment scales up, its `DESIRED`, `CURRENT`, and `READY` parameter values increase.
You can check these values from the deployments home page.

[#automatic-scale-down]
== Automatic scale down

A scale down is triggered when a server enters an idle state or CPU demand decreases.
The following condition automatically triggers a scale down operation:

----
CURRENT_CPU_UT < 0.9*TARGET_CPU_UT
----

When an deployment scales down, its DESIRED, CURRENT, and READY parameter values decrease.
You can check these values from the deployments home page.
