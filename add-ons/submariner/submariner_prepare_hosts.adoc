= Preparing selected hosts to deploy Submariner

Before you deploy Submariner with {product-title}, you must manually prepare the clusters on the hosting environment for the connection. The requirements are different for different hosting environments, so follow the instructions for your hosting environment.

== Preparing IBM Cloud for Submariner

There are two kinds of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) on IBM Cloud: the classic cluster and the second generation of compute infrastructure in a virtual private cloud (VPC). Submariner cannot run on the classic ROKS cluster since it cannot configure the IPsec ports for the classic cluster.

To configure the ROKS clusters on a VPC to use Submariner, complete the steps in the following links:

. Before you create a cluster, specify subnets for pods and services, which avoids overlapping CIDRs with other clusters. Make sure there are no overlapping pods and services CIDRs between clusters if you are using an existing cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics[VPC Subnets] for the procedure.

. Attach a public gateway to subnets used in the cluster. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_pgw[Public Gateway] for the procedure.

. Create inbound rules for the default security group of the cluster by completing the steps in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-network-policy#security_groups_ui[Security Group]. Ensure that the firewall allows inbound and outbound traffic on 4500/UDP and 500/UDP ports for Gateway nodes, and allows inbound and outbound UDP/4800 for all the other nodes.

. Label a node that has the public gateway as `submariner.io/gateway=true` in the cluster.

. Refer to https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/calico/[Calico] to configure Calico CNI by creating IPPools in the cluster.

[#preparing-bare]
== Preparing bare metal for Submariner

To prepare bare metal clusters for deploying Submariner, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that the IPsec NATT and VXLAN ports are open.

. Customize and apply YAML content that is similar to the following example:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
    name: submariner
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:{}
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster. The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.
+
This configuration uses the default network address translation - traversal (NATT) port (4500/UDP) for your Submariner and one worker node is labeled as the Submariner gateway on your bare metal cluster.
+
Submariner uses IP security (IPsec) to establish the secure tunnels between the clusters on the gateway nodes. You can either use the default IPsec NATT port, or you can specify a different port that you configured. When you run this procedure without specifying an IPsec NATT port of 4500/UDP is automatically used for the communication.

See xref:../submariner/submariner_customizations.adoc#submariner-customizations[Customizing Submariner deployments] for information about the customization options.

== Preparing Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift for Submariner (Technology Preview)

The Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift service combines various tools and resources to help simplify the process of building container-based applications. To prepare Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters for deploying Submariner, complete the following steps:

. Download the link:https://aka.ms/az-aroext-latest.whl[Python wheel and CLI extension].

. From the Azure CLI, run the following command to install the extension:
+
----
az extension add --upgrade -s <path-to-extension>
----
+
Replace `path-to-extension` with the path to where you downloaded the `.whl` extension file.

. Run the following command to verify that the CLI extension is being used:
+
----
az extension list
----
+
If the extension is being used, the output might resemble the following example:
+
----
"experimental": false,
"extensionType": "whl",
"name": "aro",
"path": "<path-to-extension>",
"preview": true,
"version": "1.0.x"
----

. From the Azure CLI, register the preview feature by running the following command:
+
----
az feature registration create --namespace Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift --name AdminKubeconfig
----

. Retrieve the administrator `kubeconfig` by running the following command:
+
----
az aro get-admin-kubeconfig -g <resource group> -n <cluster resource name>
----
+
*Note:* The `az aro` command saves the `kubeconfig` to the local directory and uses the name `kubeconfig`. To use it, set the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` to match the path of the file. See the following example:
+
----
export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kubeconfig>
oc get nodes
----

. Import your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster to your cluster list by selecting *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* > *Import cluster* from the {product-title-short} console.

. Select the `Kubeconfig` *Import mode* and enter the content from your `kubeconfig` file in the *Kubeconfig* window. Follow the instructions in the console to complete the import.
+
You can verify that your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster was imported successfully by navigating to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* > *Cluster sets* and select the *Cluster list* tab. Then, select the checkbox for your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster that you imported and click the *Submariner add-ons* tab. 

. Select *Install Submariner add-ons* and set your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster as your *Target clusters*.

. Click *Next* to continue to the *Configure clusters* page and enter `null` in the following fields:
+
* *Base domain resource group name*
* *Subscription ID*
* *Client ID*
* *Client secret*
* *Tenant ID*
+
Follow the instructions in the console to complete the install.

. Configure Submariner to use the LoadBalancer service by running the following command on the hub cluster to edit the `submarinerconfig` CR representing your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster:
+
----
oc edit submarinerconfig -n <cluster-name> submariner
----
+
Replace `cluster-name` with the name of your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

. Set the `loadBalancerEnable` parameter to `true` and save the file before exiting.

. To verify that Submariner is using the LoadBalancer service, run the following command on your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster:
+
----
oc get svc -n submariner-operator --kubeconfig <aro kubeconfig> submariner-gateway
----
+
If Submariner is using the LoadBalancer service, the output might resemble the following example:
+
----
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                         AGE
submariner-gateway   LoadBalancer   172.28.171.61   xx.xx.xx.xx   4500:32323/UDP,4490:30963/UDP   2m31s
----

. Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* > *Cluster sets* > *Submariner add-ons* to verify that your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster *Connection status* is `Healthy`.
