= Preparing selected hosts to deploy Submariner

Before you deploy Submariner with {product-title}, you must manually prepare the clusters on the hosting environment for the connection. The requirements are different for different hosting environments, so follow the instructions for your hosting environment.

== Preparing VMware vSphere for Submariner 

Submariner uses IPsec to establish the secure tunnels between the clusters on the gateway nodes. You can use the default port or specify a custom port. When you run this procedure without specifying an IPsec NATT port, the default port is automatically used for the communication. The default port is 4500/UDP. 

Submariner uses virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) to encapsulate traffic when it moves from the worker and master nodes to the gateway nodes. The VXLAN port cannot be customized, and is always port 4800/UDP.

Submariner uses 8080/TCP to send its metrics information among nodes in the cluster, this port cannot be customized.

The following ports must be opened by your VMWare vSphere administrator before you can enable Submariner:

.VMware vSphere and Submariner ports
|===
| Name | Default value | Customizable 

| IPsec NATT
| 4500/UDP
| Yes

| VXLAN
| 4800/UDP
| No

| Submariner metrics
| 8080/TCP
| No
|===

To prepare VMware vSphere clusters for deploying Submariner, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that the IPsec NATT, VXLAN, and metrics ports are open.

. Customize and apply YAML content that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
    name: submariner
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:{}
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.
+
*Note:* The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.
+
This configuration uses the default network address translation - traversal (NATT) port (4500/UDP) for your Submariner and one worker node is labeled as the Submariner gateway on your vSphere cluster.
+
Submariner uses IP security (IPsec) to establish the secure tunnels between the clusters on the gateway nodes. You can either use the default IPsec NATT port, or you can specify a different port that you configured. When you run this procedure without specifying an IPsec NATT port of 4500/UDP is automatically used for the communication.

== Preparing bare metal for Submariner

To prepare bare metal clusters for deploying Submariner, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that the IPsec NATT, VXLAN, and metrics ports are open.

. Customize and apply YAML content that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: submarineraddon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: SubmarinerConfig
metadata:
    name: submariner
    namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
spec:{}
----
+
Replace `managed-cluster-namespace` with the namespace of your managed cluster.
+
*Note:* The name of the `SubmarinerConfig` must be `submariner`, as shown in the example.
+
This configuration uses the default network address translation - traversal (NATT) port (4500/UDP) for your Submariner and one worker node is labeled as the Submariner gateway on your bare metal cluster.
+
Submariner uses IP security (IPsec) to establish the secure tunnels between the clusters on the gateway nodes. You can either use the default IPsec NATT port, or you can specify a different port that you configured. When you run this procedure without specifying an IPsec NATT port of 4500/UDP is automatically used for the communication.

See xref:../submariner/submariner_customizations.adoc#submariner-customizations[Customizing Submariner deployments] for information about the customization options.
