= VolSync persistent volume replication service (Technology Preview)
//links?

VolSync is a Kubernetes operator that enables asynchronous replication of persistent volumes within a cluster, or across clusters with storage types that are not otherwise compatible for replication. It uses the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to overcome the compatibility limitation. After deploying the VolSync operator in your environment, you can use it to create and maintain copies of your persistent data. VolSync can only replicate persistent volume claims on {ocp} clusters that are at version 4.8, or later.
