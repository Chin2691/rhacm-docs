= Submariner add-on status is degraded after installing with the console

After adding the Submariner add-on to the clusters in your cluster set, the status in the _Connection status_, _Agent status_, and _Gateway nodes_ show unexpected status for the clusters.

[#symptom-trouble-submariner-degraded]
== Symptom: Submariner add-on status is degraded after installing with the console

You add the Submariner add-on to the clusters in your cluster set, the following status is shown in the _Connection status_, _Agent status_, and _Gateway nodes_ for the clusters:

* Connection status
** Progressing: The process to establish a connection with the Submariner add-on started.
** Degraded: The connection is not ready, possibly because the steps are  still in progress.

* Agent status
** Progressing: The installation of the Submariner agent started.
** Degraded: The Submariner agent is not running correctly, possibly because it is still in progress.

* Gateway nodes labeled
** `Progressing`: The process to label the gateway nodes started. 
** `Nodes not labeled`: The gateway nodes are not labeled, possibly because the process to label them has not completed. 
** `Nodes not labeled`: The gateway nodes are not yet labeled, possibly because the process is waiting for another process to finish.
** Nodes labeled: The gateway nodes have been labeled.

[#resolving-trouble-submariner-degraded]
== Resolving the problem: Submariner add-on status is degraded after installing with the console

* The degraded status often resolves itself as the processes complete. You can see the current step of the process by clicking the status in the table. You can use that information to determine whether the process is finished and you need to take other troubleshooting steps.

* For an issue that does not resolve itself, complete the following steps to troubleshoot the problem: 

. Use the `benchmark` command with the `subctl` tool to establish a base on which to compare when you run additional diagnostics. 
+
See https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#benchmark[`benchmark`] in the Submariner documentation for additional information about the options for the command. 

. You can use the `diagnose` command with the `subctl` utility to run some tests on the Submariner connections. See https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#diagnose[`diagnose`] in the Submariner for more information about how to run the command. 

. If a problem continues with the `Connection status`, you can run the `verify` command with your `subctl` utility tool to test the connection between two Submariner clusters. The basic format for the command is:
+
----
subctl verify --kubecontexts <cluster1>,<cluster2> [flags]
----
+
Replace `cluster1` and `cluster2` with the names of the clusters that you are testing. See https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#verify[`verify`] in the Submariner documentation for more information about the command.
