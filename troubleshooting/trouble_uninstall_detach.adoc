== Resolving the problem: Failed unistallation because resources exist

This error occurs when you try to uninstall the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster while it is still managing clusters. All clusters must be removed from management before uninstalling the hub cluster. 

Detach all clusters that are still being managed by the hub cluster and try to uninstall again. 

For more information about detaching clusters, see the _Removing a cluster from management_ section by selecting the information for your provider in link:../manage_cluster/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster-with-red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Creating a cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes].
