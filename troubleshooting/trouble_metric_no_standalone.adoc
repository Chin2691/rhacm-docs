[#resolving-the-problem-standalone-cluster-metrics-missing]
== Resolving the problem: Metric for standalone cluster is missing

As a subscription operator, manually create the metrics service for your standalone cluster. Complete the following steps:

. Create the metrics `Service` resource for your standalone cluster. Add your metrics `Service` resource for your managed cluster. Your YAML might resemble the following file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: standalone-subscription-metrics
  name: standalone-subscription-metrics
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      port: 8389
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8389
  selector:
    app: multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Run the following command to apply your file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. After you add your new metrics service for your standalone cluster, verify that the metrics service is created. Run the following command:

+
----
oc get svc -n open-cluster-management standalone-subscription-metrics
----

The metrics service should appear on your standalone cluster.
