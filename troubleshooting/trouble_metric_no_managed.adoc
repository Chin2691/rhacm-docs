= Troubleshooting managed cluster metrics missing

Managed cluster metrics might not be collected.

[#symptom-managed-cluster-metrics-missing]
== Symptom: Metric for managed cluster is missing

If the metrics service is missing on the managed cluster, then metrics are not collected.

[#identifying-the-problem-managed-cluster-metrics-missing]
== Identifying the problem: Metric for managed cluster is missing

Check for the metrics service on the managed cluster with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
oc get svc -n open-cluster-management mc-subscription-metrics
----

Results are displayed. If the `mc-subscription-metrics` is not listed, you must manually add the metric service.

[#resolving-the-problem-managed-cluster-metrics-missing]
== Resolving the problem: Metric for managed cluster is missing

As a subscription operator, manually create the metrics service for your managed cluster. Complete the following steps:

. Create and apply the metrics `Service` resource for the managed cluster. Run the following command to start a new YAML file:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f
----

. Add your metrics `Service` resource for your managed cluster. Your YAML might resemble the following file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: mc-subscription-metrics
  name: mc-subscription-metrics
  namespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
spec:
  ports:
  - name: metrics
    port: 8388
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8388
  selector:
    component: application-manager
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
----

. After you add your new metrics service for your managed cluster, verify that the metrics service is created. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get svc -n open-cluster-management hub-subscription-metrics
----

The metrics service is now available on your managed cluster.

//is there a reason why we might want the user to be aware of the Port difference?
//Note the use of the non-conventional port 8388 (instead of the
conventional 8381).
