== Identifying the problem: Metric for hub cluster is missing

Check for the metrics service on your hub cluster with the following command:

----
oc get svc -n open-cluster-management hub-subscription-metrics
----

If the `hub-subscription-metrics` is not listed, you must manually add the metric service.

== Resolving the problem: Metric for hub cluster is missing

As a cluster administrator, create the metrics service for your hub cluster. Complete the following steps: 

. Create the metrics `Service` resource. Add your metrics `Service` resource for your hub cluster. Your YAML might resemble the following file:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hub-subscription-metrics
  name: hub-subscription-metrics
  namespace: open-cluster-management
spec:
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      port: 8381
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8381
  selector:
    app: multicluster-operators-hub-subscription
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
----

. Run the following command to apply the file:

+
----
oc apply -f
----

. Verify that the metrics service is created. Run the following command:

+
----
oc get svc -n open-cluster-management hub-subscription-metrics
----

The metrics service should appear on your standalone cluster.
