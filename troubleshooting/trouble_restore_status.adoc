= Troubleshooting restore status shows _PartiallyFailed_

After you restore a backup, resources are restored correctly but the OADP Operator shows a `PartiallyFailed` status.

[#symptom-restore-partiallyfailed]
== Symptom: Restore status shows _PartiallyFailed_

The OADP Operator shows a `PartiallyFailed` status in the console.

[#resolving-restore-partiallyfailed]
== Resolving the problem: Restore status shows _PartiallyFailed_

If you restore from a backup that is empty, you can safely ignore the `PartiallyFailed` status.

{product-title} restore shows a cumulative status for all Velero restore resources. If one status is `PartiallyFailed` and the others are `Completed`, the cumulative status you see is `PartiallyFailed` to notify you that there is at least one issue.

To resolve the issue, check the status for all individual Velero restore resources or resources with a `PartiallyFailed` status and view the logs for more details. You can get the log from the object storage directly or download it from the OADP Operator by using the DownloadRequest custom resource.

To create a DownloadRequest from the console, complete the following steps:

. Navigate to *Operators* > *Installed Operators* > *Create DownloadRequest*.

. Select `BackupLog` as your *Kind*. Follow the console instructions to complete the DownloadRequest creation.
