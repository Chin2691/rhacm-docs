[#custom-metrics]
= Custom metrics

You can manage your custom metrics for your hub clusters and managed clusters. Continue reading to understand which metrics can be scrapped from both hub and managed clusters, and where to manage custom metrics.

[#custom-metrics-hub]
== Hub cluster custom metrics

You can expose specific hub cluster metrics to be scrapped. View the following table for descriptions of the metrics that can be scrapped from the hub cluster:


|===
|Name |Help |Labels
|propagation_successful_time 
|Histogram of successful propagation
latency 
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_
|propagation_failed_time 
|Histogram of failed propagation latency
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_
|===

[#custom-metrics-managed]
== Managed cluster custom metrics

Similar to the hub cluster metrics, view the following table for descriptions of the metrics that can be scrapped from your managed clusters:



|===
|Name |Help |Labels
|git_successful_pull_time 
|Histogram of successful git pull latency
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_
|git_failed_pull_time |Histogram of failed git pull latency
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_
|local_deployment_successful_time 
|Histogram of successful local
deployment latency 
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_
|local_deployment_failed_time 
|Histogram of failed local deployment
latency 
|_subscription_namespace__subscription_name_

[#custom-metrics-observability-]
== Observability custom metrics
Observability custom metrics are listed in the `metrics_list.yaml` section of the `MultiClusterObservability` resource. Before you add a custom metric, verify that `mco observability` is enabled. Read _Adding custom metrics_ for more information.
