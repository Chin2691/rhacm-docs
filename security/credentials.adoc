[#credentials]
= Credentials

You can rotate your credentials for your {product-title} clusters.

[#rotating-credentials]
== Provider credentials

[#aws-rotate]
=== Amazon Web Services

See the procedure to rotate the following credentials for your cluster:

  - aws_access_key_id
  - aws_secret_access_key

. View the resources in the namespace that has the same name as the cluster with the expired credential. 				
. Find the secret name `<cluster_name>-<cloud_provider>-creds`. For example: `my_cluster-aws-creds1`.				
. Edit the secret to replace the existing value with the updated value.
