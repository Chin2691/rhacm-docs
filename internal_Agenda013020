Issues created for epics. Waiting to find out what happens at commitment pitch. Need more information for the existing ones
Brandi moved files and created issue
Mikela looking into ASCIIDoc


Updates from Red Hat meeting with Dawn, Ali, and Juliana:
Culture is similar, but has a certain factor that no one can seem to explain. It is more open to idea expression. They were happy with how things go.
  They are open to our way of working, at least at the beginning. They are understanding and supportive of the changes, and don't want to force us into a tailspin with too much change.
Red Hat has a centralized ID team.
  When geographically possible, they sit near the developers. Space is very limited, so sometimes the best you can get is on a different floor of the same location.
  Under the OpenShift line of business
  Similar to squad structure. About 28 squads, but not all need documentation. Not 1 ID to 1 squad. 
  Content strategist works closely with customers and has the overview of the documentation branding.
  Writers work more with internal teams, though I want to know if we can have some access to customer interaction.
  Builds:
     They refresh daily using Pantheon. 
     There is a build focal, and builds are automated. 
     OpenShift builds in two different places, with single-sourcing.
  Translation: 
     JA mostly, but sometimes KO and zh_CN. They have someone who handles this. 
  Writing:
     AsciiDoc is what they use for source
     Files in public Git repo
     Jira and Bugzilla for issues
     Topic-based
     Conditional processing, I think

02/06/20
Met with build person:
- Build using Pantheon
- Build works based on Git pushes
- Have a local link checker as part of the build process, but does not check external links
- Translation is mainly JA for OpenShift, and it needs to be done at GA
  - Send multiple packages like we do at IBM to make sure it is done in time for GA
- Possibility of linking to an IBM release, though that is not great UX
- Raised possibility (for feasibility) of building at IBM for the first release, pulling html files from GSA, then pushing html directly over there
  - We would convert files to AsciiDoc during 2nd quarter
  - Save time and conversion effort for 1Q with all of the changes
  - Other teams are working on similar efforts like this, but not markdown, and they will try to identify who they are so we can find out their experience
  - Maybe use Pandoc to convert? Mikela is looking into that some
  - Drawbacks: 
    - Build will not be able to build the second version of the docs from html
    - Will have to have Red Hat IDs to test it and use local builds
    - Translation might not work. Have to find out if t11n is required for Q1. Product is not being translated
- ACM name might change
- Brandi created a summary file, we need to pull the files that we need over to the new repo.
- Offers supposed to be out this week
- Sounds like we will likely be where we requested in the poll

- Blockers: 
  - Accessing information on their side

Appreciation:
- Mikela for looking into some asciidoc options
- Brandi for her work on the issues, repo, and summary file
