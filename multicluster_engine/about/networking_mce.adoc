[#network-configuration-infra-operator-mce]
== Additional networking requirements when installing using the infrastructure operator

When you are installing bare metal managed clusters with the Infrastructure Operator, see the following table for the additional networking requirements:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Hub cluster outbound to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTPS (HTTP in a disconnected environment
| Used to create an ISO image on the {product-title-short} hub
| 443 (80 in disconnected environments)

| Hub cluster outbound to BMC interface at single node {ocp-short} managed cluster
| HTTPS (HTTP in disconnected environment)
| Boot the {ocp-short} cluster
| 443

| Outbound from the {ocp-short} managed cluster to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Reports hardware information using the `assistedService` route 
| 443

| Outbound from the {ocp-short} managed cluster to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTP
| Downloads the rootfs image
| 80

[#network-configuration-hive-mce]
== Additional networking requirements when installing using the Hive Operator

When you are installing bare metal managed clusters with the Hive Operator, which includes using Central Infrastructure Management, you must configure a layer 2 or layer 3 port connection between the hub cluster and the `libvirt` provisioning host. This connection to the provisioning host is required during the creation of a base metal cluster with Hive. See the following table for more information:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Hub cluster outbound and inbound to the `libvirt` provisioning host
| IP
| Connects the hub cluster, where the Hive operator is installed, to the `libvirt` provisioning host that serves as a bootstrap when creating the bare metal cluster
| 

|===

**Note:** These requirements only apply when installing, and are not required when upgrading clusters that were installed with Infrastructure Operator.

[#network-configuration-hosted-control-planes]
=== Hosted control planes networking requirements (Technology Preview)

When you use hosted control planes, the `HypershiftDeployment` resource must have connectivity to the following endpoints:

* {ocp-short} control-plane and worker nodes
* AWS API
* S3 API
* Azure API
* Registration agents for all managed clusters
* {ocp-short} image repositories that store the ISO images of the coreOS and the image registry for {ocp-short} pods
* {product-title-short} hub connects to the klusterlet that runs on a hosting cluster
* Local API client of the klusterlet on the hosting cluster communicates with the API of the HyperShift hosted cluster
