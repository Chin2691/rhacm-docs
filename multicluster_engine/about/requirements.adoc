= Requirements and recommendations

Before you install the {mce}, review the following system configuration requirements and settings:

* <<supported-operating-systems-and-platforms,Supported operating systems and platforms>>
* xref:../networking_mce.adoc#networking-mce[Networking]

*Important:* You must install multicluster engine for Kubernetes on a cluster that does not have Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes earlier than 2.5 installed. The multicluster engine for Kubernetes cannot co-exist with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes on versions earlier than 2.5 because they provide some of the same management components. It is recommended that you install multicluster engine for Kubernetes on a cluster that has never previously installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. If you are using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes at version 2.5.0 or later then multicluster engine for Kubernetes will already be installed on the cluster with it.
