= Creating hosted control plane clusters (Technology Preview)

You can use the {mce} console to create a {ocp} hosted cluster.

[#hosted-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating a hosted cluster:

* You must have a deployed {mce} hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.6 or later.
* You need internet access for your {mce} hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the cluster.
* You must enable the hosted control plane operator. See xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_control_planes_intro.adoc#hosted-control-planes-intro[Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for more information. 
* You need an {ocp-short} image pull secret. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets] for more information.
* You need an infrastructure environment with discovered hosts.
+
*Note:* When you create a cluster by using a host from your inventory and a disconnected installation, you must store all your settings in the credential in the _Configuration for disconnected installation_ section. You cannot enter them in the cluster creation console editor.

[#create-hosted]
== Creating a hosted control plane cluster

To create a hosted control plane cluster from the {mce} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* > *Host inventory* > *Hosted* and complete the steps in the console. 

*Important:* When you create a cluster, the {mce} controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

*Tip:* Select *YAML: On* to view content updates as you enter the information in the console.

If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster. Hosted control plane clusters must use one of the provided release images.

Proxy information that is provided in the infrastructure environment is automatically added to the proxy fields. You can use the existing information, overwrite it, or add the information if you want to enable a proxy. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy: 

* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.
  
When you review your information and optionally customize it before creating the cluster, you can select *YAML: On* to view the YAML content in the panel. You can edit the YAML file with your custom settings, if you have any updates.  

*Note:* You have to run the `oc` command that is provided with the cluster details to import the cluster. When you create the cluster, it is not automatically configured with the management of {product-title-short}.

[#importing-hosted-cluster-ui]
== Importing a hosted control plane cluster with the console

You can import a hosted control plane cluster with the console by navigating to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* and selecting the hosted cluster you want to import. Then, click *Import hosted cluster*.

[#importing-hosted-cluster-cli]
== Importing a hosted control plane cluster with the CLI

You can import a hosted control cluster with the CLI by completing the following steps:

. Add an annotation to the `HostedCluster` CR by running the following command:
+
----
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/hypershiftdeployment: local-cluster/<cluster_name>
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedcluster-name: <cluster_name>
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Create your `ManagedCluster` resource by using the following sample YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:  
  annotations:    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-cluster-name: local-cluster    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-deploy-mode: Hosted
    open-cluster-management/created-via: other  
  labels:    
    cloud: auto-detect    
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: default    
    name: <cluster_name>  
    vendor: OpenShift  
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:  
  hubAcceptsClient: true  
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
----
oc apply
----

. After importing, your hosted cluster becomes visible in the console. You can also check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

[#hosting-service-cluster-access]
== Accessing a hosting service cluster

The access secrets for hosted control plane clusters are stored in the `hypershift-management-cluster` namespace. Learn about the following secret name formats:

- `kubeconfig` secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig` (clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig)
- `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password` (clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password)
