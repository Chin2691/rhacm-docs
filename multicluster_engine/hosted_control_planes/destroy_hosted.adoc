= Destroying hosted control plane clusters

Destroying hosted control plane clusters does not disable the hosted control plane features. If want to disable the feature, you must first destroy both the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on the [mce]. Destroying only the hosted cluster, or only the managed cluster resource, might cause issues when you create the hosted cluster again, or if you are using the same managed cluster name.
