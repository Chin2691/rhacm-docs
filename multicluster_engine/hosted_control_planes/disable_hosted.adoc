[#hypershift-uninstall-operator]
== Uninstalling the HyperShift operator

To uninstall the HyperShift operator from a management or hosting cluster, delete the `hypershift-addon` `ManagedClusterAddon` from the management cluster by running the following command:

----
oc delete managedclusteraddon -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----
+
*Note:* If at least one hosted cluster exists and you delete `hypershift-addon`, you remove only the add-on agent from the managed cluster. If no hosted cluster exists and you delete the `hypershift-addon`, you uninstall the HyperShift operator on the managed cluster as well.
