[#hypershift-uninstall-operator]
== Uninstalling the HyperShift operator

To uninstall the HyperShift operator from a management or hosting service cluster, delete the `hypershift-addon` `ManagedClusterAddon` from the management cluster by running the following command:

----
oc delete managedclusteraddon -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----
+
*Note:* Deleting the `hypershift-addon` only removes the add-on agent from the managed cluster if there is at least one hosted cluster. If there is no hosted cluster, deleting the `hypershift-addon` uninstalls the HyperShift operator on the managed cluster as well.
