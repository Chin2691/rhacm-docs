= Adding hosts to an infrastructure environment

You can use the {product-title} console to add hosts to an infrastructure environment. Adding the hosts makes it easier to select the already-configured hosts when you are creating a cluster. 

Complete the following steps to add a host:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation, select *Infrastructure* > *Infrastructure environments*.

. Select the infrastructure environment to which you want to add the host to view its settings.

. Select the _Hosts_ tab to view the hosts that are already added to that environment. Available hosts might take a few minutes to appear in the table. 

. Select *Discovery ISO* or *Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)* to enter the information for your host. The following list contains the information to add:
+
* Host name: The name of the host.
* IP address: The IP address of the host. 
* Domain name: The domain where the host is accessed.
