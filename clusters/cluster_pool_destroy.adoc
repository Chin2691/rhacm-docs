= Destroying a cluster pool

If you created a cluster pool and determine that you no longer need it, you can destroy the cluster pool. When you destroy a cluster pool, you destroy the clusters that were in the cluster pool and release the resources of the hibernating clusters. 

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

To destroy a cluster pool, complete the following steps: 

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the *Cluster pools* tab.

. Find the name of the cluster pool in the _Cluster pools_ table.

. Click the _Options_ menu to view the options for the cluster pool.

. Select *Destroy cluster pool*.

. Enter the name of the cluster pool to confirm.

. Select *Destroy* to remove the cluster pool. The clusters in the destroyed cluster pool are removed from the console while they are destroyed.

*Tip:* You can destroy multiple cluster pools with one action by selecting the box for each of the the cluster pools and using the _Actions_ menu to destroy the selected cluster pools.
