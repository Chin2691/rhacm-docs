= Cluster lifecycle overview

Your cluster is created by using the {ocp} cluster installer with the Hive resource. After you install {mce} you are able to managed clusters with cluster lifecycle features. You can find more information about the process of installing {ocp-short} clusters at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/installing/ocp-installation-overview[OpenShift Container Platform installation overview].

The cluster lifecylce component is provided by the {mce}. After you install {product-title}, you can continue adding and managing clusters in the cluster lifecycle phase. Start with link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/cluster_lifecycle_intro.adoc#cluster-overview[Cluster lifecycle overview] and all the documentation for that operator. 

If you install {product-title}, you get more advanced cluster management. {product-title-short} has two main types of clusters: _hub clusters_ and _managed clusters. Managed clusters are created and managed by the {mce}, which is installed automatically with {product-title-short}. The hub cluster is the main cluster with {product-title-short} installed. You can create, manage, and monitor other Kubernetes clusters with the hub cluster. 

The managed clusters are Kubernetes clusters that are managed by the hub cluster with {mce-short}. You can create clusters by using the {product-title-short} hub cluster, while you can also import existing clusters to be managed by the hub cluster.

Release images are the version of {ocp-short} that you use when you create a cluster. For clusters that are created using {product-title-short}, you can enable automatic upgrading of your release images. For more information about release images in {product-title-short}, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/release_images.adoc#release-images[Release images].
