= Leveraging hosted control plane clusters (Technology Preview)

You can host the control planes for your {ocp} version 4.10.7, or later, clusters on pods by using hosted control planes. With hosted control planes, the control plane pods can be hosted on a single cluster by designating a hosting service cluster on either the {product-title} hub cluster, or on a cluster that {product-title-short} manages. The control plane pods are maintained by the hosting service cluster, lowering the cost of your infrastructure by maintaining the hosted control planes on a single cluster. A hosted control plane cluster can also require less time that a normal cluster takes to get up and running. 

This feature is only available on Amazon Web Services.
