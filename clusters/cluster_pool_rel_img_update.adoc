= Updating the cluster pool release image

When the clusters in your cluster pool remain in hibernation for some time, the {ocp} release image of the clusters might become backlevel. If this happens, you can upgrade the version of the release image of the clusters that are in your cluster pool.  

*Required access*: Cluster administrator

Complete the following steps to update the {ocp-short} release image for the clusters in your cluster pool:

*Note:* This procedure does not update clusters from the cluster pool that are already claimed. It updates the release images for all of the remaining hibernating clusters that are created from this cluster pool after you complete this procedure. 

. From the navigation menu, click *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*.

. Select the *Cluster pools* tab.

. Find the name of the cluster pool that you want to update in the _Cluster pools_ table.

. Click the _Options_ menu to see the available options.

. Select *Update release image*.

. Select a new release image to use for future cluster creations from this cluster pool.
      
. Select *Update* to apply the selected release image.

*Tip:* You can update the release image for multiple cluster pools with one action by selecting the box for each of the the cluster pools and using the _Actions_ menu to update the release image for the selected cluster pools.
