[#hibernating-a-created-cluster]
= Hibernating a created cluster

You can hibernate a cluster that was created using {product-title} to conserve resources. A hibernating cluster requires significantly fewer resources than one that is running, so you can potentially lower your provider costs by easily moving clusters in and out of a hibernating state. This feature only applies to clusters that were created by {product-title-short} in the following environments:

* Amazon Web Services
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform
* VMware vSphere
* Red Hat OpenShift on OpenStack

[#hibernate-cluster]
== Hibernate a cluster

To hibernate a cluster that was created by {product-title-short}, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation menu, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. Ensure that the *Manage clusters* tab is selected.

. Find the cluster that you want to hibernate.

. Select *Hibernate cluster* from the the _Options_ menu for that cluster. *Note:* If the *Hibernate cluster* option is not available, you cannot hibernate the cluster. This can happen when the cluster was imported, and not created by {product-title-short}.

. Select *Hibernate* in the confirmation dialog box to hibernate the cluster.

The status for the cluster on the _Clusters_ page is `Hibernating` when the process completes. 

*Tip:* You can hibernate multiple clusters by selecting the clusters that you want to hibernate on the _Clusters_ page, and selecting *Actions* > *Hibernate clusters*.

[#resuming-normal-operation-of-a-hibernating-cluster]
== Resuming normal operation of a hibernating cluster

To resume normal operation of a hibernating cluster, complete the following steps:

. From the {product-title-short} navigation menu, select *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. Ensure that the *Manage clusters* tab is selected.

. Find the cluster that is hibernating and you want to resume.

. Select *Resume cluster* from the the _Options_ menu for that cluster.

. Select *Resume* in the confirmation dialog box to resume the function of the cluster.

The status for the cluster on the _Clusters_ page is `Ready` when the process completes. 

*Tip:* You can resume multiple clusters by selecting the clusters that you want to resume on the _Clusters_ page, and selecting *Actions* > *Resume clusters*.
