= Using hosted control plane clusters (Technology Preview)

{product-title} version 2.5 and multicluster engine version 2.0 can deploy {ocp} clusters using two different control plane configurations. The standalone configuration uses multiple dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the {ocp-short} control plane. Starting with {product-title-short} version 2.5 and multicluster engine version 2.0, you can provision hosted control planes. By provisioning hosted control planes, you provision the {ocp-short} control plane as pods on a hosting service cluster without the need for dedicated physical machines for each control-plane.

The control plane is run as pods that are contained in a single namespace and is associated with the hosted control plane cluster. When {ocp-short} provisions this type of hosted cluster, it provisions its worker node independent of the control plane. For {product-title-short}, Amazon Web Services is supported as a Technology Preview.

Some of the benefits of hosted control plane clusters include:

* Saves cost by removing the need to host independent control plane nodes.

* Creates a distinct division of control between the control plane and the worker nodes. The control plane can run in one account or cloud, while the workers can run in a different one.

* Decreases provisioning time of a cluster to approximately 10 minutes. 

* Provides highly available upgrades.

* Supports cross platform hosting, in which the control plane can run in a different provider than the workers.

* Supports turn key deployments or fully customized {ocp-short} provisioning.

You can host the control planes for your {ocp} version 4.10.7. This feature is only available for  Amazon Web Services.
