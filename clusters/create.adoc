= Creating a cluster

Learn how to create {ocp} clusters across cloud providers with {product-title}.

Multicluster-engine uses the Hive operator that is provided with {ocp-short} to provision clusters for all providers except the on-premises clusters and hosted control planes. When provisioning the on-premises clusters, multicluster-engine uses the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) and Assisted Installer function that are provided with {ocp-short}. The hosted clusters for hosted control planes are provisioned by using the HyperShift operator.
