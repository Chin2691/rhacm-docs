A `ManagedClusterSet` is a group of managed clusters. A managed cluster set, can help you manage access to all of your managed clusters. You can also create a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource to bind a `ManagedClusterSet` resource to a namespace.

Each cluster must be a member of a managed cluster set. When you install the hub cluster, a `ManagedClusterSet` resource is created called `default`. All clusters that are not assigned to a managed cluster set are automatically assigned to the `default` managed cluster set. You cannot delete or update the `default` managed cluster set.

*Note:* Cluster pools that are not added to a managed cluster set are not added to the default `ManagedClusterSet` resource. After a cluster is claimed from the cluster pool, the cluster is added to the default `ManagedClusterSet`.

When you create a managed cluster, the following are automatically created to ease management:

- A `ManagedClusterSet` called `global`.
- The namespace called `open-cluster-management-global-set`.
- A `ManagedClusterSetBinding` called `global` to bind the `global` `ManagedClusterSet` to the `open-cluster-management-global-set` namespace.

*Important:* You cannot delete, update, or edit the `global` managed cluster set. The `global` managed cluster set includes all managed clusters. See the following example:
