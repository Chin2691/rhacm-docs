[#add-host-host-inventory]
= Adding hosts to the host inventory by using the Discovery Image

After creating your host inventory (infrastructure environment), you can discover your hosts and add them to your inventory. Download an ISO and attach it to each server with the method you choose, such as by using virtual media or writing the ISO to a USB drive.

*Important:* Keep the Discovery ISO media connected to the device during the installation process and set each host to boot from the device one time.

You can the URL to download the ISO in the `isoDownloadURL` property in the status of your `InfraEnv` resource. See xref:cim_create_cli.adoc#create-host-inventory-cli[Creating a host inventory by using the command line interface] for more information about the `InfraEnv` resource.

Each booted host creates an agent resource in the same namespace. You must approve each host before you can use it. See xref:cim_manage_cli.adoc#cim-manage_cli[Managing host inventories by using the agent resource] to learn more about the agent resource.
