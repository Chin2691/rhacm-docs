[#custom-api-certificates]
== Customizing API server certificates

The default OpenShift Kube API server certificate is issued by an internal {ocp} cluster certificate authority (CA). By following the guidance in _Adding API server certificates_ in the {ocp-short} documentation, you can add one or more alternative certificates that the API server returns based on the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) requested by the client.

You might need to change the certificate of the OpenShift API server. Changing the certificate might impact the communication between the managed cluster and the hub cluster. When you add the named certificate before installing the product, you can avoid an issue that might leave your managed clusters in an offline state.

The following list contains some examples of when you might need to update your certificates: 

* You want to add a named certificate for the external load balancer. By adding a named certificate with host name `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, you can replace the default API server certificate for the external load balancer. Replacing the certificate might leave some of your managed clusters in an offline state. If your clusters are in an offline state after upgrading the certificates, follow the troubleshooting instructions for _Troubleshooting imported clusters offline after certificate change_ to resolve it.

* The certificate for your external load balancer is expiring. 

* The name of your certificate is invalid. Managed clusters must use the host name `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` to access the hub cluster. You cannot use named certificates that are configured with other host names.

=== Replacing the existing named certificate for the external load balancer

Complete the following steps to replace a certificate: 

. Locate your `APIServer` custom resource, which resembles the following example: 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  audit:
    profile: Default
  servingCerts:
    namedCertificates:
    - names:
      - api.mycluster.example.com
      servingCertificate:
      name: old-cert-secret
----

. Create a new secret in the `openshift-config` namespace that contains the content of the existing and new certificates by running the following commands:
+
----
cp old.crt combined.crt
cat new.crt >> combined.crt
oc create secret tls combined-certs-secret --cert=combined.crt --key=old.key -n openshift-config {code}
----

. Update your `APIServer` resource to reference the combined certificate as the `servingCertificate`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  audit:
    profile: Default
  servingCerts:
    namedCertificates:
    - names:
      - api.mycluster.example.com
      servingCertificate:
      name: combined-cert-secret
----

. After about 15 minutes, the CA bundle containing both new and old certificates is propagated to the managed clusters.

. Create another secret named `new-cert-secret` in the `openshift-config` namespace that contains only the new certificate information by entering the following command:
+
----
oc create secret tls new-cert-secret --cert=new.crt --key=new.key -n openshift-config {code}
----

. Update the `APIServer` resource by changing the name of `servingCertificate` to reference the `new-cert-secret`. Your resource might resemble the following example: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  audit:
    profile: Default
  servingCerts:
    namedCertificates:
    - names:
      - api.mycluster.example.com
      servingCertificate:
      name: new-cert-secret
----

After about 15 minutes, the old certificate is removed from the CA bundle, and the change is automatically propagated to the managed clusters.
