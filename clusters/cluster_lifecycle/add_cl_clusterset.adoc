[#adding-cluster-managedclusterset]
= Adding a cluster to a _ManagedClusterSet_

After you create your `ManagedClusterSet`, you can add clusters to your managed cluster set by either following the instructions in the console or by using the CLI.

[#adding-clusters-managedclusterset-cli]
== Adding clusters to a _ManagedClusterSet_ by using the CLI

Complete the following steps to add a cluster to a managed cluster set by using the CLI:

. Ensure that there is an RBAC `ClusterRole` entry that allows you to create on a virtual subresource of `managedclustersets/join`.
+
*Note:* Without this permission, you cannot assign a managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`. If this entry does not exist, add it to your YAML file. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: clusterrole1
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclustersets/join"]
    resourceNames: ["<cluster_set>"]
    verbs: ["create"]
----
+
Replace `<cluster_set>` with the name of your `ManagedClusterSet`.
+
*Note:* If you are moving a managed cluster from one `ManagedClusterSet` to another, you must have that permission available on both managed cluster sets. 

. Find the definition of the managed cluster in the YAML file. See the following example definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true 
----

. Add the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset` paremeter and specify the name of the `ManagedClusterSet`. See the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: <cluster_set>
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
