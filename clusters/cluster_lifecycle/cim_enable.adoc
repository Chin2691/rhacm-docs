[#enable-cim]
= Enabling the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) service

The CIM service is provided with the {mce-short} and deploys {ocp-short} clusters. CIM is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator on the hub cluster, but you have to enable the service manually.

[#enable-cim-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

See the following prerequisites before creating an host inventory:

- You must have a deployed hub cluster on {ocp-short} version 4.11 or later.
- You need internet access for your hub cluster (connected), or a connection to an internal or mirror registry that has a connection to the internet (disconnected) to retrieve the required images for creating the environment.
- You need a configured instance of the Central Infrastructure Management (CIM) feature on your hub cluster.
- You must have the Bare Metal Operator installed on your hub cluster.
- You need an {ocp-short} link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret]. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/images/managing-images#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets] for more information. 
- You need your SSH key that is in your `id_rsa.pub` file by default. The default file path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
- You need a configured storage class.
- For disconnected environments only, complete the procedure for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/scalability_and_performance/clusters-at-the-network-far-edge#ztp-acm-preparing-to-install-disconnected-acm_ztp-deploying-disconnected[Clusters at the network far edge] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#enable-cim-provision]
== Modifying the provisoning resource

You can skip this topic if your hub cluster is installed on one of the following platforms:

- Bare metal
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform
- VMware vSphere
- User-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) method and the platform is `None`

If your hub cluster is on any other platform, continue at . If your hub cluster in installed on a platfrom from the previous list, modify the `Provisioning` resource to allow the Bare Metal Operator to watch all namespaces by running the following command:
+
----
oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"watchAllNamespaces": true }}'
----

[#enable-cim-disconnected]
== Enabling CIM in disconnected environments

To enable CIM in disconnected environments, complete the following steps:

. Create a `ConfigMap` in the same namespace as your infrastructure operator to specify the values for `ca-bundle.crt` and `registries.conf` for your mirror registry. Your file `ConfigMap` might resemble the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <mirror-config>
  namespace: "<infrastructure-operator-namespace>"
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |    
    <certificate-content>
  registries.conf: |
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
    [[registry]]
       prefix = ""
       location = "registry.redhat.io/multicluster-engine"
       mirror-by-digest-only = true
       [[registry.mirror]]
       location = "mirror.registry.com:5000/multicluster-engine"
----
+
Registries in the list of `unqualified-search-registries` are automatically added to an authentication ignore list in the `PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` environment variable. The specified registries do not require authentication when the pull secret of the managed cluster is validated.

. Create the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by saving the following YAML content in the `agent_service_config.yaml` file:
+
*Important:* If you are using the late binding feature and the `spec.osImages` releases in the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource are version 4.13 or later, the {ocp-short} release images that you use when creating your clusters must be version 4.13 or later. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS images for version 4.13 and later are not compatible with images earlier than version 4.13.

<1> Replace `mirror_config` with the name of the `ConfigMap` that contains your mirror registry configuration details.
+
<2> Include the optional `unauthenticated_registry` parameter if you are using a mirror registry that does not require authentication. Entries on this list are not validated or required to have an entry in the pull secret. 
+
<3> Replace `img_volume_size` with the size of the volume for the `imageStorage` field, for example `10Gi` per operating system image. The minimum value is `10Gi`, but the recommended value is at least `50Gi`. This value specifies how much storage is allocated for the images of the clusters. You need to allow 1 GB of image storage for each instance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS that is running. You might need to use a higher value if there are many clusters and instances of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS.
+
<4> Replace `ocp_version` with the {ocp-short} version to install, for example, `4.13`.
+
<5> Replace `ocp_release_version` with the specific install version, for example, `49.83.202103251640-0`.
+
<6> Replace `iso_url` with the ISO url, for example, `https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/4.10.3/rhcos-4.10.3-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso`. You can find other values at the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/4.10.3/[4.10.3 dependencies].

Your CIM service is configured. You can verify that it is healthy by checking the `assisted-service` and `assisted-image-service` deployments and ensuring that their pods are ready and running.
