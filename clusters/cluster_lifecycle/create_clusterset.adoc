= Creating a ManagedClusterSet

You can group managed clusters together in a managed cluster set to limit the user access on managed clusters.  

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

A `ManagedClusterSet` is a cluster-scoped resource, so you must have cluster administration permissions for the cluster where you are creating the `ManagedClusterSet`. A managed cluster cannot be included in more than one `ManagedClusterSet`. You can create a managed cluster set from either the {mce} console or from the CLI.

[#creating-managedclusterset-cli]
== Creating a ManagedClusterSet by using the CLI

Add the following definition of the managed cluster set to your YAML file to create a managed cluster set by using the CLI:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSet
metadata:
  name: <cluster_set>
----

Replace `<cluster_set>` with the name of your managed cluster set.
