= Release images

When you create a cluster on a provider by using {mce-short}, you must specify a release image to use for the new cluster. The release image specifies which version of {ocp} is used to build the cluster. By default, the `clusterImageSets` resources are used by {ocp-short} to get the list of supported release images.

The https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository] contains the YAML files for the `clusterImageSets` that are supported by {ocp-short}. The contents of this Git repository is organized using a directory structure to separate images based on the {ocp-short} version and the release channel value: `fast`, `stable`, `candidate`. The branches in the Git repository maps to the {ocp-short} release, where each branch contains `clusterImageSets` YAML files that are supported by the corresponding {ocp-short} release.

In {mce-short}, a cluster image set controller that runs on the hub cluster. This controller queries the https://github.com/stolostron/acm-hive-openshift-releases[acm-hive-openshift-releases GitHub repository], at set intervals, for new `clusterImageSets` YAML files. By default, the controller synchronizes with the `fast` channel in the `backplane-2.2` branch.
