= Adding day-2 nodes to an existing cluster fails pending user action

Adding a new node (scale out) to your existing cluster created by the multicluster engine for Kubernetes (MCE), with  Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) or Host inventory create methods. The installation on this node fails. More on concrete, the installation goes oka during the first (discovery phase), but it fails on the installation phase. Using RHACM GUI you will see a pending user action. In the description, you can see it is failing on the rebooting step.

The configuration of the network is failing. Therefore, the message on what could be failing would be not very accurate. Because the agent cannot longer report information back.
 
[#symptom-worker-node-fail]
== Symptom: Installation for day two workers fails

At the Discover phase, the host cannot configure the network. Check for the following symptoms and messages:
----
This host is pending user action. Host timed out when pulling ignition. Check the host console...
----

Also check all the MCs (we need this actual term) from the `/sysroot/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` or `/sysroot/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` file paths. 

Check the failing host for the following messages:

----
system: Stopped Create Volatile Files and Directories...
----
----
system: Stopped target Swap...
----

[#resolving-cluster-rotating-agents]
== Resolving the problem: Manually configure the network

Perform the following task to manually configure your network:

. Delete the node from your hub cluster.
. Create your cluster from the console again.
. Add or append the following annotation to the BMH of the new node:

----
"bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/installer-args": "[\"--append-karg\", \"coreos.force_persist_ip\"]"
----

The node starts the installation, and after the Discovery phase, merges the network configuration between your changes and the initial phase.
