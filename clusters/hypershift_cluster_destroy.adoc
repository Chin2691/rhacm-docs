= Destroying a HyperShift hosted cluster
//name, file name, and placement of this content in question. 

To destroy a HyperShift hosted cluster, delete the `HypershiftDeployment` resource by running the following command: 

----
oc delete hypershiftdeployment hypershift-demo -n default
----

Your HyperShift cluster is destroyed. 
// again, this is absolutely not a verification step. Usually I take the time to get a command from the developer to check, if that is not happening, we need to leave this off.
