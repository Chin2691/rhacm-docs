= Installing the hosted control planes command line interface

The hosted control planes (`hypershift`) command line interface is used to create and manage {ocp-short} hosted control plane clusters. After you enable the hosted control planes feature, you can install the hosted control planes command line interface by completing the following steps:

. From the {ocp-short} console, click the *Help icon* > *Command Line Tools*.

. Click *Download hypershift CLI* for your platform.


*Note:* The download is only visible if you have enabled the `hypershift-preview` feature.

. Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:

+
----
tar xvzf hypershift.tar.gz
----

. Run the following command to make the binary file executable:

+
----
chmod +x hypershift
----

. Run the following command to move the binary file to a directory in your path:

+
----
sudo mv hypershift /usr/local/bin/.
----

You can now use the `hypershift create cluster` command to create and manage hosted clusters. Use the following command to list the available parameters:
