[#create-hosted-aws]
= Creating a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the console

. Create a hosted control plane cluster from the {mce-short} console by navigating to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. 

. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* > *Amazon Web Services* > *Hosted* and complete the steps in the console. 
+
*Important:* When you create a cluster, the {mce-short} controller creates a namespace for the cluster and its resources. Ensure that you include only resources for that cluster instance in that namespace. Destroying the cluster deletes the namespace and all of the resources in it.

. If you want to add your cluster to an existing cluster set, you must have the correct permissions on the cluster set to add it. If you do not have `cluster-admin` privileges when you are creating the cluster, you must select a cluster set on which you have `clusterset-admin` permissions. If you do not have the correct permissions on the specified cluster set, the cluster creation fails. Contact your cluster administrator to provide you with `clusterset-admin` permissions if you do not have any cluster set options to select.

. Assign every managed cluster to a managed cluster set. Every managed cluster must be associated with a managed cluster set. If you do not assign the managed cluster to a `ManagedClusterSet`, it is automatically added to the `default` managed cluster set.

. Ensure that your hosted control plane cluster uses one of the provided release images. The release image identifies the version of the {ocp-short} image that is used to create the cluster.

. To import the cluster, run the `oc` command that is provided with the cluster details. When you create the cluster, it is not automatically configured with the management of {product-title-short}.

[#create-hosted-aws-proxy]
== Proxy information for hosted clusters

Proxy information that is provided in the infrastructure environment is automatically added to the proxy fields. 

If you want to enable a proxy, you can use the existing information, overwrite it, or add the information. The following list contains the required information for creating a proxy: 

* HTTP proxy URL: The URL that should be used as a proxy for `HTTP` traffic. 

* HTTPS proxy URL: The secure proxy URL that should be used for `HTTPS` traffic. If no value is provided, the same value as the `HTTP Proxy URL` is used for both `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.

* No proxy domains: A comma-separated list of domains that should bypass the proxy. Begin a domain name with a period `.` to include all of the subdomains that are in that domain. Add an asterisk `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations. 

* Additional trust bundle: The contents of the certificate file that is required to access the mirror registry.

[#create-hosted-multi-zone-aws]
== Creating a hosted cluster in multiple zones on AWS

Create a cluster, specifying the `BASE_DOMAIN` of the public zone, by entering the following commands:

----
REGION=us-east-1
ZONES=us-east-1a,us-east-1b
CLUSTER_NAME=example
BASE_DOMAIN=example.com
AWS_CREDS="$HOME/.aws/credentials"
PULL_SECRET="$HOME/pull-secret"

hcp create cluster aws \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-pool-replicas=3 \
--base-domain $BASE_DOMAIN \
--pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
--aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
--region $REGION \
--zones $ZONES <1>
----

<1> The `--zones` flag must specify availability zones within the region that is specified by the `--region` flag. The `--zones` flag is also available on the `hypershift create infra aws` command that is used to create infrastructure separately.
//lahinson - july 2023 - update hypershift cli command above
The following per-zone infrastructure is created for all specified zones:

* Public subnet
* Private subnet
* NAT gateway
* Private route table (public route table is shared across public subnets)

One `NodePool` resource is created for each zone. The node pool name is suffixed by the zone name. The private subnet for zone is set in `spec.platform.aws.subnet.id`.
