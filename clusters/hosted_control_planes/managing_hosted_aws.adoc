[#hosted-control-planes-manage-aws]
= Managing hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview)

You can use the {mce} console to create a {ocp} hosted cluster. Hosted control planes are available as a Technology Preview on Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you use hosted control planes on AWS, you can create a hosted cluster by using the console, or you can import a hosted cluster by using either the console or the CLI.

[#hosted-prerequisites-aws]
== Prerequisites

You must configure hosted control planes before you can create hosted control plane clusters. See xref:../../clusters/hosted_control_planes/configure_hosted_aws.adoc#hosting-service-cluster-configure-aws[Configuring hosted control planes (Technology Preview)] for more information.

[#create-hosted-aws]
== Creating a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the console

To create a hosted control plane cluster from the {mce-short} console, navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters*. On the _Clusters_ page, click *Create cluster* > *Amazon Web Services* > *Hosted* and complete the steps in the console. 

*Note:* After reaching the console, the UI will only provide basic information on how to create a cluster.

[#hosted-deploy-cluster-aws]
== Deploying a hosted cluster on AWS with the CLI

After setting up the HyperShift command line interface and enabling the `local-cluster` as the hosting cluster, you can deploy a hosted cluster on AWS by completing the following steps:

. Set environment variables as follows, replacing variables as needed with your credentials:
+
----
export REGION=us-east-1
export CLUSTER_NAME=clc-name-hs1
export INFRA_ID=clc-name-hs1
export BASE_DOMAIN=dev09.red-chesterfield.com
export AWS_CREDS=$HOME/name-aws
export PULL_SECRET=/Users/username/pull-secret.txt
export BUCKET_NAME=acmqe-hypershift
export BUCKET_REGION=us-east-1
----
+
. Verify that `CLUSTER_NAME` and `INFRA_ID` have the same values, otherwise the cluster might not appear correctly in the {mce} console. To see descriptions for each variable, run the following command
+
----
hypershift create cluster aws --help
----

. Verify that you are logged into your hub cluster.

. Run the following command to create the hosted cluster:
+
----
hypershift create cluster aws \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --infra-id $INFRA_ID \
    --aws-creds $AWS_CREDS \
    --pull-secret $PULL_SECRET \
    --region $REGION \
    --generate-ssh \
    --node-pool-replicas 3 \
    --namespace <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----
+
*Note:* By default, all `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the `clusters` namespace. If you specify the `--namespace <namespace>` parameter, `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` custom resources are created in the namespace you chose.

. You can check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get hostedclusters -n <hypershift-hosting-service-cluster>
----

[#importing-hosted-cluster-aws]
== Importing a hosted control plane cluster on AWS

You can import a hosted control plane cluster with the console.

. Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Clusters* and select the hosted cluster that you want to import.

. Click *Import hosted cluster*.

+
*Note:* For your _discovered_ hosted cluster, you can also import from the console, but the cluster must be in an upgradable state. Import on your cluster is disabled if the hosted cluster is not in an upgradable state because the hosted control plane is not available. Click *Import* to begin the process. The status is `Importing` while the cluster receives updates and then changes to `Ready`.

You can also import a hosted control plane cluster on AWS with the CLI by completing the following steps:

. Add an annotation to the `HostedCluster` custom resource by running the following command:
+
----
oc edit hostedcluster <cluster_name> -n clusters
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to add the annotations to the `HostedCluster` custom resource:
+
----
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/hypershiftdeployment: local-cluster/<cluster_name>
cluster.open-cluster-management.io/managedcluster-name: <cluster_name>
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Create your `ManagedCluster` resource by using the following sample YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:  
  annotations:    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-cluster-name: local-cluster    
    import.open-cluster-management.io/klusterlet-deploy-mode: Hosted
    open-cluster-management/created-via: other  
  labels:    
    cloud: auto-detect    
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset: default    
    name: <cluster_name>  
    vendor: OpenShift  
  name: <cluster_name>
spec:  
  hubAcceptsClient: true  
  leaseDurationSeconds: 60
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
----
oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace <file_name> with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. Create your `KlusterletAddonConfig` resource by using the following sample YAML file. This only applies to {product-title-short}. If you have installed {mce-short} only, skip this step:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: KlusterletAddonConfig
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name>
  namespace: <cluster_name>
spec:
  clusterName: <cluster_name>
  clusterNamespace: <cluster_name>
  clusterLabels:
    cloud: auto-detect
    vendor: auto-detect
  applicationManager:
    enabled: true
  certPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  iamPolicyController:
    enabled: true
  policyController:
    enabled: true
  searchCollector:
    enabled: false
----
+
Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your hosted cluster.

. Run the following command to apply the resource:
+
----
oc apply -f <file_name>
----
+
Replace <file_name> with the YAML file name you created in the previous step.

. After the import process is complete, your hosted cluster becomes visible in the console. You can also check the status of your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
----
oc get managedcluster <cluster_name>
----

[#hosting-service-cluster-access-aws]
== Accessing a hosting cluster on AWS

The access secrets for hosted control plane clusters are stored in the `hypershift-management-cluster` namespace. Learn about the following secret name formats:

- `kubeconfig` secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig` (clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig)
- `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hostingNamespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password` (clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password)

[#hypershift-cluster-destroy-aws]
== Destroying a hosted cluster on AWS

To destroy a hosted cluster and its managed cluster resource, complete the following steps:

. Delete the hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running the following command:
+
----
hypershift destroy cluster aws --name <cluster_name> --infra-id <infra_id> --aws-creds <aws-credentials> --base-domain <base_domain> --destroy-cloud-resources
----
+
Replace names where necessary.

. Delete the managed cluster resource on {mce-short} by running the following command:
+
----
oc delete managedcluster <cluster_name>
----
+
Replace `cluster_name` with the name of your cluster.
