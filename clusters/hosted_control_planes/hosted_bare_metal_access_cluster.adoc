[#access-hosted-cluster-bm]
= Accessing the hosted cluster on bare metal (Technology Preview)

The hosted control plane is running and the agents are ready to join the hosted cluster. Before the agents join the hosted cluster, you need to access the hosted cluster.

. Generate the kubeconfig by entering the following command:
+
----
hypershift create kubeconfig --namespace ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} --name ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} > ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig
----
+
If you access the cluster by entering the following command, the output shows that you do not have any nodes and that the ClusterVersion is trying to reconcile the {ocp} release:
+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get clusterversion,nodes
----
+
.Example output
----

To get the cluster running, you need to add nodes to it.
