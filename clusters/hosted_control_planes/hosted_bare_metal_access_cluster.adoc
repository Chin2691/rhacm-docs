= Accessing the hosted cluster (Technology Preview)

To access the hosted cluster, you need to run the `oc` or `kubectl` commands on the hosted cluster and then fetch the `kubeconfig` file.

. Generate the `kubeconfig` file by entering the following command:
+
----
hypershift create kubeconfig --namespace ${CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE} --name ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} > ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig
----
+
If you access the cluster by entering the following command, the output shows that you do not have any nodes and that the ClusterVersion is trying to reconcile the {ocp} release:
+
----
oc --kubeconfig ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig get clusterversion,nodes
----
+
.Example output
