= Creating an InfraEnv resource for hosted control planes on bare metal (Technology Preview)

An `InfraEnv` is a environment where hosts that are starting the live ISO can join as agents. In this case, the agents are created in the same namespace as your hosted control plane.

. Create an `InfraEnv` resource:
//lahinson - June 2023 - To make this information easier for users to parse, we need to replace the heredoc syntax with instructions to (1) create the yaml file to define the InfraEnv resource and (2) enter the command to create the InfraEnv resource. Please check my revision for accuracy.

.. Create a YAML file to contain the configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  name: ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}
  namespace: ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  pullSecretRef:
    name: pull-secret
  sshAuthorizedKey: ${SSH_PUB_KEY}
----

.. Save the file as `infraenv-config.yaml`.

.. Apply the configuration by entering the following command:
+
----
oc apply -f infraenv-config.yaml
----

. To generate a live ISO that allows virtual machines or bare metal machines to join as agents, enter the following command:
+
----
oc -n ${HOSTED_CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE} get InfraEnv ${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME} -ojsonpath="{.status.isoDownloadURL}"
