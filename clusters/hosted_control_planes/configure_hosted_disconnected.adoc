[#configure-hosted-disconnected]
= Configuring hosted control planes in a disconnected environment

In the context of hosted control planes, a disconnected environment is an {ocp-short} deployment that is not connected to the internet and that uses hosted control planes as a base.

[#mce_and_agent]
== Disconnected environment architecture

When you provision hosted control planes on bare metal, you use the Agent platform. The Agent platform and {mce-short} work together to enable disconnected deployments. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the central infrastructure management service, see xref:../cluster_lifecycle/cim_enable.adoc#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

*Note:* You can deploy hosted control planes in a disconnected environment on bare-metal platforms. On the {ocp-virt} platform, hosted control planes in a disconnected environment is available as a Technology Preview feature. 

[#configure-hosted-disconnected-networks]
== Configuring hosted control planes in a disconnected environment

You can deploy hosted control planes in a disconnected environment by using an IPv4, IPv6, or dual stack network. 

Before you complete any network-specific steps, complete the steps in xref:../hosted_control_planes/monitor_user_workload_disconnected.adoc#monitor-user-workload-disconnected[Monitoring user workload in a disconnected environment], which is a procedure that is required no matter which network you use.

Then, complete the steps that are specific to your network:
