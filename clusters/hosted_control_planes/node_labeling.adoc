= Labeling nodes for hosted control planes

Before you get started with hosted control planes for {ocp-short}, you must properly label nodes so that the pods of hosted clusters can be scheduled into infrastructure nodes. Node labeling is also important for the following reasons:

* To ensure high availability and proper workload deployment
* To ensure that control planes are well contained

The following procedure is a prerequisite to deploying hosted control planes.

+
----
spec:
nodeSelector:
role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----
