= Configuring DNS for an IPv6 network

This step is mandatory for both disconnected and connected environments in both virtual and bare metal environments. The key distinction between virtual and bare metal environment lies in the location where you configure the resources. In a bare-metal environment, use a solution like Bind rather than a lightweight solution like `dnsmasq`.

* To configure DNS for an IPv6 network on a virtual environment, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/create_hosted_clusters_kubevirt_default_ingress_dns.adoc#create-hosted-clusters-kubevirt-default-ingress-dns[Default ingress and DNS behavior].

* To configure DNS for an IPv6 network on bare metal, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted_bare_metal_dns.adoc#configure-dns-bm[Configuring DNS on bare metal].

Next, deploy a registry.
