Learn about network requirements for both the hub cluster and the managed cluster.

Enhancements during this release might require changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle``. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`.See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html in the Networking section of {ocp} for more information.

the multi-cluster hub and backplane operators will now make the trusted CA bundle available in the ACM and MCE namespaces. It will still be necessary for ACM/MCE developers to update their components to use this bundle.
