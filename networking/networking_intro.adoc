Learn about network requirements for both the hub cluster and the managed cluster.

Enhancements during this release might require changes to your network. The trusted CA bundle ConfigMap uses the default name of `trusted-ca-bundle`. You can change this name by providing it to the operator in an environment variable named `TRUSTED_CA_BUNDLE`.See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html in the _Networking_ section of {ocp} for more information.
