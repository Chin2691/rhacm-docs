[#advanced-config-hub]
= MultiClusterHub advanced configuration 

{product-title} is installed using an operator that deploys all of the required components. {product-title-short} can be further configured during or after installation by adding one or more of the following attributes to the MultiClusterHub custom resource.

[#custom-image-pull-secret]
== Custom Image Pull Secret

[#availability-config]
== `availabilityConfig`

[#disable-hub-self-management]
== `disableHubSelfManagement`

By default, the {product-title-short} hub is automatically imported and managed by itself, like any other cluster. If you do not want the {product-title-short} hub to manage itself, then change the setting for `disableHubSelfManagement` from `false` to `true`. If the setting is not included in the YAML file that defines the custom resource, add it.


The following example shows the default template to use if you want to disable the hub self-management feature. Replace `namespace` with the name of your project namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterHub
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  disableHubSelfManagement: true
----

[#disable-update-cluster-image-sets]
== `disableUpdateClusterImageSets`

[#custom-ca-configmap]
== `customCAConfigmap`

[#enable-cluster-proxy-addon]
== `enableClusterProxyAddon`

[#ssl-ciphers]
== `sslCiphers`
