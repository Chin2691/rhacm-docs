== Upgrading from version 1.0 to version 2.0

If you are upgrading from the technology preview version of {product-title} (1.x) to the generally available version (2.0), you must remove version 1.0 and install version 2.0 as a clean installation. Upgrading directly from the product technology preview version 1.x of {product-title-short} to version 2.0 is not supported. 

Complete the following steps to upgrade from version 1.x to version 2.0:

. Detach each of your managed clusters from your {product-title-short} hub cluster before unistalling the hub cluster. See link:../manage_cluster/create_ocp_aws.adoc#aws_removing-a-cluster-from-management[Removing a cluster from management] for instructions that explain how to remove the managed clusters.

. Uninstall {product-title-short} version 1.x by completing the procedure in xref:../install/uninstalling.adoc#uninstalling[Uninstalling].

. Install {product-title-short} version 2.0 by completing the procedure in xref:../install/install_connected.adoc#installing-while-connected-online[Installing while connected online].

When you install version 2.0, you can enable automatic upgrades for future versions within the same major release by selecting the *autormatic upgrade* setting. If you prefer to run manual updates, you can select *manual upgrade*. 
+
* Automatic upgrade. If you select Automatic upgrades when you install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager automatically upgrades the version when a compatible upgrade is available. This method ensures that you always have the latest version of the operator with the latest fixes.

* Manual upgrade. If you select Manual upgrades when you install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator, the cluster administrator determines when an upgrade occurs.
When a compatible upgrade is available, the Operator Lifecycle Manager creates a request to upgrade. Someone with cluster administrator access must approve the request to upgrade to the new version.

For more information about upgrading your operator, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Adding operators to a cluster].
