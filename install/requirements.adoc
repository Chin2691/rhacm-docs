|===


[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections.

[#network-configuration-hub]
=== Hub cluster networking requirements

For the hub cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Retrieval of logs dynamically from Search console for the pods of the managed cluster. This connection uses a service running on the managed cluster called - `klusterlet-addon-workmgr`
| 443

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kubernetes API server of the managed cluster that is provisioned during installation to install the Klusterlet
| 6443

| Outbound
| HTTPS
| The channel source, including GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using Application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Managed cluster to push metrics and alerts (alerts are gathered only for managed clusters running {ocp-short} version 4.8, or later)
| 443

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kube API Server of Hub being watched for changes from Managed Cluster
| 6443

| Outbound to GitHub, GitLab, or similar
| HTTPS
| Download manifests from Git to configure GitOps
| 443

| Inbound
| Post-commit hook from GitHub to the hub cluster. This setting is only required when you use certain application management functions.
| 6443

| Outbound to `ObjectStore`
| HTTPS
| Sends metric data of Observability for long term storage in the `ObjectStore`
| 443

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

|===

[#network-configuration-managed]
=== Managed cluster networking requirements

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

For the managed cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Watches the Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster for changes
| 6443

| Outbound
| The managed cluster to the channel source, which includes GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

| Outbound to GitHub, GitLab, or similar
| HTTPS 
| The managed cluster to the GitHub, GitLab, or similar to download manifests for GitOps
| 443

|===

[#network-configuration-infra-operator]
=== Additional networking requirements when using the infrastructure operator

When you are using bare metal managed clusters that were created with the Infrastructure Operator, see the following table for the additional networking requirements:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Hub cluster outbound to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTPS (HTTP in a disconnected environment
| Used to create an ISO image on the {product-title-short} hub
| 443 (80 in disconnected environments)

| Hub cluster outbound to BMC interface at single node OpenShift managed cluster
| HTTPS (HTTP in disconnected environment)
| Boot the single node OpenShift cluster
| 443

| Outbound from the single node OpenShift managed cluster to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Reports hardware information using the `assistedService` route 
| 443

| Outbound from the single node OpenShift managed cluster to the ISO/rootfs image repository
| HTTP
| Downloads the rootfs image
| 80

|===

[#network-configuration-submariner]
=== Submariner networking requirements

Clusters that are using Submariner require three open ports. The following table shows which ports you might use:

|===
| Direction | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound and inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4800/UDP

| Outbound and inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 4500/UDP, 500/UDP, and any other ports that are used for IPSec traffic on the gateway nodes

| Inbound
| Each of the managed clusters
| 8080/TCP

|===

[#network-configuration-app-deploy]
=== Application deployment network requirements

In general, the application deployment communication is one way from a managed cluster to the hub cluster. The connection uses `kubeconfig`, which is configured by the agent on the managed cluster. The application deployment on the managed cluster needs to access the following namespaces on the hub cluster:

* The namespace of the channel resource
* The namespace of the managed cluster

[#network-configuration-namespace]
=== Namespace connection network requirements

* Application lifecycle connections:
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the console API on port 4000.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to expose the Application UI on port 3001.

* Application lifecycle backend components (pods):
+
On the hub cluster, all of the application lifecycle pods are installed in the `open-cluster-management` namespace, including the following pods:

** multicluster-operators-hub-subscription
** multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription
** multicluster-operators-channel
** multicluster-operators-application
** multicluster-integrations

+
As a result of these pods being in the `open-cluster-management` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.

+
On the managed cluster, only the `klusterlet-addon-appmgr` application lifecycle pod is installed in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
    
* Governance and risk:
+
On the hub cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
** The namespace `open-cluster-management` needs to access the OpenShift DNS on port 5353.

+ 
On the managed cluster, the following access is required:

** The namespace `open-cluster-management-addon` needs to access the Kube API on port 6443.
