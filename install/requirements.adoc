[#network-configuration]
== Network configuration

Configure your network settings to allow the connections in the following sections.

[#network-configuration-hub]
=== Hub cluster networking requirements

For the hub cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Retrieval of logs dynamically from Search console for the pods of the managed cluster. This connection creates a route called `klusterlet-addon-workmgr` in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace of the managed cluster. The host of the route is `<route name>-<namespace>.apps.<cluster domain>`.
| 443

| Outbound to managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kubernetes API server of the managed cluster that is provisioned during installation to install the Klusterlet
| 6443

| Outbound to the channel source
| HTTPS
| The channel source, including GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using Application lifecycle, OpenShift GitOps or ArgoCD to connect to these sources.
| 443

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Managed cluster to push metrics and alerts (alerts are gathered only for managed clusters running {ocp-short} version 4.8, or later)
| 443

| Inbound from the managed cluster
| HTTPS
| Kube API Server of hub cluster being watched for changes from managed cluster
| 6443

| Outbound to `ObjectStore`
| HTTPS
| Sends metric data of Observability for long term storage in the ObjectStore **and/or** when the Cluster Backup Operator is running.
| 443

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

[#network-configuration-managed]
=== Managed cluster networking requirements

*Note:* `Registration Agent` and `Work Agent` on the managed cluster do not support proxy settings because they communicate with `apiserver` on the hub cluster by establishing an mTLS connection, which cannot pass through the proxy.

For the managed cluster networking requirements, see the following table:

|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified)

| Inbound from the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Sending of logs dynamically for the pods of the managed cluster. This connection uses a service running on the managed cluster called - `klusterlet-addon-workmgr`
| 443

| Inbound from the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Kubernetes API server of the managed cluster that is provisioned during installation to install the Klusterlet
| 6443

| Outbound to image repository
| HTTPS
| Access images for {ocp-short} and {product-title-short} 
| 443

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Managed cluster to push metrics and alerts (alerts are gathered only for managed clusters running {ocp-short} version 4.8, or later)
| 443

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| Watches the Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster for changes
| 6443

| Outbound to the channel source
| HTTPS
| The managed cluster to the channel source, which includes GitHub, Object Store, and Helm repository. This is only required when you are using application lifecycle to connect to these sources.
| 443

| Outbound to the hub cluster
| HTTPS
| For cluster-proxy add-on on the managed cluster to register.
