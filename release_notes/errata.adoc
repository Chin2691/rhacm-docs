* Fixes issue with `placementrule` and `placementbinding` not being deleted when a disabled policy in the console was deleted. (GitHub 12689)

* Removes channel role and role binding that was created in the product system namespace. This fix avoids exposing system secrets to managed cluster service accounts. (GitHub 12319)

* Fixes an issue with Hive controller not showing the correct version. (GitHub 12013)

* Fixes an issue with Observability crash. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1967890[Bugzilla 1967890])
