By default, Errata updates are automatically applied when released. See link:../install/upgrade_hub.adoc#upgrading-by-using-the-operator[Upgrading by using the operator] for more information.

FIPS notice: If you do not specify your own ciphers in `spec.ingress.sslCiphers`, then the `multiclusterhub-operator` provides a default list of ciphers. For 2.4, this list includes two ciphers that are _not_ FIPS approved. If you upgrade from a version 2.4.x or earlier and want FIPS compliance, remove the following two ciphers from the `multiclusterhub` resource: `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` and `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305`.

== Errata 2.4.2

* Fixes an issue that caused some policies that support `LimitRange` to not adopt the changes to some of the attributes after the pod is restarted. (GitHub #19160)

* Delivers updates to one or more of the product container images.

== Errata 2.4.1

* Filters out all of the policies that are sourced by governance and risk from the `PolicyReport` data shown on the managed cluster details view, as the count for those policies is displayed elsewhere on that page. (GitHub #17438)

* Removes the optional sample `imagepullsecret` parameter in the Operatorhub Installation console to prevent accidental use of a pull secret that does not exist on their cluster. (GitHub #17884)

* Fixes an issue that caused a hibernating cluster in a cluster pool to hang in `Detaching` status when you destroy the cluster and the managed cluster status does not become `Unknown`. After upgrading to ACM 2.4.1, all clusters that were hung in a `Detaching` status, along with their namespaces, automatically terminate and resume expected behavior. No manual intervention should be required to clean up these clusters or their namespaces on the hub cluster. (GitHub #18249)

* Removes the required step to enable the feature gate to add a central infrastructure management (CIM) environment.

* Fixes an issue that prevented the validation errors caused by a failed `ClusterDeployment` from surfacing in the `ClusterPool` console. (Bugzilla #1995380)

* Delivers updates to one or more of the product container images.
