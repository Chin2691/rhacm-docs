= Multicluster global hub

The multicluster global hub is a set of components that enable the management of multiple hub clusters from a single hub cluster. You can complete the following tasks by using the multicluster global hub:

- Deploy managed hub clusters
- List the managed clusters that are managed by all of the managed hub clusters

The multicluster global hub is useful when a single hub cluster cannot manage the large number of clusters in a high-scale environment. The multicluster global hub designates multiple managed clusters as multiple managed hub clusters. The global hub cluster manages the managed hub clusters.
