= Importing a managed hub cluster in the default mode

To import an existing hub cluster as a managed hub cluster, complete the following steps: 

. Disable the cluster self-management in the existing {product-title} hub cluster by setting the `disableHubSelfManagement` setting to `true` in the `multiclusterhub` custom resource. This setting disables the automatic importing of the hub cluster as a managed cluster.

. Import the managed hub cluster by completing the steps in link:../clusters/cluster_lifecycle/import.adoc#importing-a-target-managed-cluster-to-the-hub-cluster[Importing a target managed cluster to the hub cluster].

. After the managed hub cluster is imported, check the {global-hub} agent status to ensure that the agent is running in the managed hub cluster by running the following command:
