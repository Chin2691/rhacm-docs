[#global-hub-install-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you install multicluster global hub, see the following requirements:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator. *{ocp-short} Dedicated environment required access:* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions. By default `dedicated-admin` role does not have the required permissions to create namespaces in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment. 

* {product-title} version 2.7 or later must be installed and configured. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9[Learn more details about {product-title-short}].

* Networking requirements: The managed hub is also a managed cluster of global hub in {product-title-short}. The network configuration in {product-title-short} is necessary. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/networking/networking[Networking] for {product-title-short} networking details.

** Global hub networking requirements
+
|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified) | Source address |	Destination address |
    
| Inbound from browser of the user | HTTPS | User need to access the Grafana dashboard | 443 | Browser of the user | IP address of Grafana route |
| Outbound to Kafka Cluster | HTTPS | Global hub manager need to get data from Kafka cluster | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-manager-xxx pod | Kafka route host |
| Outbound to PostgreSQL database | HTTPS | Global hub manager need to persist data to PostgreSQL database | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-manager-xxx pod | IP address of the PostgreSQL database |
|===

** Managed hub networking requirements
+
|===
| Direction | Protocol | Connection | Port (if specified) | Source address |	Destination address |
    
| Outbound to Kafka Cluster | HTTPS | Global hub agent need to sync cluster info and policy info to Kafka cluster | 443 | multicluster-global-hub-agent pod | Kafka route host |

* *Optional:* Configured middleware. Multicluster global hub has built-in Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana, but you can use your own configured Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana. See xref:../global_hub/global_hub_existing_components.adoc#global-hub-integrating-existing-components[Integrating existing components] for more details.

[#global-hub-install-support-matrix]
== Supported components

* Supported browsers
+
Because they share the same interface, the Global Hub console user interface supports the same browsers as the {ocp}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/web_console/index#web-console[Accessing the web console] in the {ocp} documentation for information about supported browsers and versions.

* Supported platforms
+
Multicluster global hub has two main components:

** A server component called the “global hub cluster” where the management tools and the user interface run
** A client component that is installed on {product-title-short} called the "managed hub" that can be managed by the “global hub cluster”

The managed hub also manages other clusters.
You do not have to use a dedicated cluster for your global hub cluster.

The platforms that support the Platform	Supported for global hub cluster are shown in the following table:

|===
|Platform | Supported for global hub cluster
{product-title-short} | Supported for managed hub cluster

|{product-title-short} 2.9, and later 2.9.x releases | Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.8.3, and later 2.8.x releases |	Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.7.9, and later 2.7.x releases |	Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.6, and earlier releases |	No |	No
|===

* Supported middleware

** The multicluster global hub supports Kafka 3.3 and later 3.3.x releases. 

** The multicluster global hub supports PostgreSQL version 13 and later 13.x releases.
