[#global-hub-install-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you install multicluster global hub, see the following requirements:

*Required access:* Cluster administrator. *{ocp-short} Dedicated environment required access:* You must have `cluster-admin` permissions. By default `dedicated-admin` role does not have the required permissions to create namespaces in the {ocp-short} Dedicated environment. 

* {product-title} version 2.7 or later must be installed and configured. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9[Learn more details about {product-title-short}].

* Networking requirements: The managed hub is also a managed cluster of global hub in {product-title-short}. The network configuration in {product-title-short} is necessary. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/networking/networking[Networking] for {product-title-short} networking details.

* *Optional:* Configured middleware. Multicluster global hub has built-in Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana, but you can use your own configured Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Grafana. See xref:../global_hub/global_hub_existing_components.adoc#global-hub-integrating-existing-components[Integrating existing components] for more details.

[#global-hub-install-support-matrix]
== Supported components

* Supported browsers
+
Because they share the same interface, the Global Hub console user interface supports the same browsers as the {ocp}. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.14/html-single/web_console/index#web-console[Accessing the web console] in the {ocp} documentation for information about supported browsers and versions.

* Supported platforms
+
Multicluster global hub has two main components:

** A server component called the “global hub cluster” where the management tools and the user interface run
** A client component that is installed on {product-title-short} called the "managed hub" that can be managed by the “global hub cluster”

The managed hub also manages other clusters.
You do not have to use a dedicated cluster for your global hub cluster.

The platforms that support the Platform	Supported for global hub cluster are shown in the following table:

|===
|Platform | Supported for global hub cluster
{product-title-short} | Supported for managed hub cluster

|{product-title-short} 2.9, and later 2.9.x releases | Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.8.3, and later 2.8.x releases |	Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.7.9, and later 2.7.x releases |	Yes |	Yes
|{product-title-short} 2.6, and earlier releases |	No |	No
|=== 


* Supported middleware

** The multicluster global hub supports Kafka 3.3 and later 3.3.x releases. 

** The multicluster global hub
supports PostgreSQL version 13 and later 13.x releases.

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected]
== Installing multicluster global hub in a disconnected environment

If a network connection is not available, you can deploy the multicluster global hub operator in a disconnected environment.

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-prereq]
=== Additional prereqisites for installing in a disconnected environment

You must meet the following requirements before you install multicluster global hub in a disconnected environment:

- An image registry and a bastion host that have access to both the Internet and to your mirror registry

- Operator Lifecycle Manager link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html[{olm}] installed on your cluster

- The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[oc], link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/opm/cli-opm-install.html[opm], and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.html#installation-oc-mirror-installing-plugin_installing-mirroring-disconnected[oc-mirror] plugins

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-mirror]
==== Configure a mirror registry

You must use a local mirror image registry when installing multicluster global hub in a disconnected environment. The image registry ensures that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content. 

Because you have already installed {ocp-short} in your disconnected environment, you already set up a mirror registry during the {ocp-short} cluster installation.

You can complete the following procedures to provision the mirror registry for the global hub:

- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/disconnected-installation-mirroring#creating-mirror-registry[Create a mirror registry]

- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/installing/disconnected-installation-mirroring#installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation]

[#global-hub-packages-in-catalog]
==== Create operator packages in your mirror catalog by using the oc-mirror plug-in

Red Hat provides the multicluster global hub and AMQ Streams operators in the Red Hat operators catalog, which are delivered by the `registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index` index image. When you prepare your mirror of this catalog index image, you can choose to either mirror the entire catalog as provided by Red Hat, or you can mirror a subset that contains only the operator packages that you intend to use.

If you are creating a full mirror catalog, no special considerations are needed as all of the packages required to install multicluster global hub and AMQ Streams are included. However, if you are creating a partial or filtered mirrored catalog, for which you identify particular packages to be included, you must to include the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` package names in your list. 

Complete the following steps to create a local mirror registry of the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` packages:

. Create a `ImageSetConfiguration` YAML file to configure and add the operator image. Your YAML file might resemble the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
storageConfig:
  registry:
      imageURL: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.12
      type: ocp
  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.12
    packages:
    - name: multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh
    - name: amq-streams
  additionalImages: []
  helm: {}
----

. Mirror the image set directly to the target mirror registry by using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml docker://myregistry.example.com:5000
----

. Mirror the image set in a fully disconnected environment. For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/installing/disconnected-installation-mirroring#installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation].

[#global-hub-add-reg-in-catalog]
==== Adding the registry and catalog to your disconnected cluster

Make your mirror registry and catalog available on your disconnected cluster. Complete the steps:

. Disable the default catalog sources of OperatorHub. Run the following command to update the `OperatorHub` resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
-p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----

. Mirror the Operator catalog link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html-single/operators/index#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[Mirroring the Operator catalog]

//my main concern here is the amount of time that we take the user away from the RHACM docs. Based on the instructions from Adding a catalog source for your mirrored catalog, how should a RHACM user add multicluster global hub catalog to the mirrored catalog?
. Add the `CatalogSource` resource for your mirrored catalog into the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Your `CatalogSource` YAML file might be similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-catalog-source
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  image: myregistry.example.com:5000/mirror/my-operator-index:v4.12
  sourceType: grpc
  secrets:
  - <global-hub-secret>
----
//**Important:** Take note of the value of the `metadata.name` field, which you will need later.
. Save the updated file.

. Verify that the required packages are available from your disconnected cluster by querying the available `PackageManifest` resources. Run the following command:
with the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc -n openshift-marketplace get packagemanifests`
----
+
The list that is displayed should include entries showing that the `multicluster-global-hub-operator-rh` and `amq-streams` packages are supplied by the catalog source for your mirror catalog:


[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-image-registry]
==== Configure the image registry

You can configure the image registry by using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` on your disconnected cluster to redirect image references to your mirror registry. This enables you to have your cluster obtain container images for the global hub operator on your mirror registry, rather than from the Internet-hosted registries. 

*Note:* The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` can only support the image mirror with image digest.

If you mirrored your catalog using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command, the needed image content source policy configuration is in the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file inside of the `manifests-*` directory that is created by that command.

If you used the `oc-mirror` plug-in to mirror your catalog instead, the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file is within the `oc-mirror-workspace/results-*` directory that is created by the oc-mirror plug-in.

In either case, you can apply the policies to your disconnected command using an `oc apply` or `oc replace` command such as `oc replace -f ./<path>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`

The required image content source policy statements can vary based on how you created your mirror registry, but are similar to this example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  labels:
    operators.openshift.org/catalog: "true"
  name: global-hub-operator-icsp
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/multicluster-globalhub
    source: registry.redhat.io/multicluster-globalhub
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/openshift4
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4
  - mirrors:
    - myregistry.example.com:5000/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/redhat
----

You can configure different image registries for different managed hubs with the `ManagedClusterImageRegistry`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html-single/clusters/index#import-cluster-managedclusterimageregistry[Importing a cluster that has a ManagedClusterImageRegistry] to use the `ManagedClusterImageRegistry` API to replace the agent image.

By completing the previous step, a label and an annotation are added to the selected `ManagedCluster`. This means that the agent image in the cluster is replaced with the mirror image.

* Label: `open-cluster-management.io/image-registry=<namespace.managedclusterimageregistry-name>`
* Annotation: `open-cluster-management.io/image-registries: <image-registry-info>`

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret]
==== Configure the image pull secret

If the Operator or Operand images that are referenced by a subscribed Operator require access to a private registry, you can either link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html-single/operators/index#olm-creating-catalog-from-index_olm-managing-custom-catalogs[provide access to all namespaces in the cluster, or to individual target tenant namespaces]. 

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret-generic]
===== Configure the global hub image pull secret in an {ocp-short} cluster

*Note:* Applying the image pull secret on a pre-existing cluster causes a rolling restart of all of the nodes.

. Export the user name from the pull secret:
+
----
export USER=<the-registry-user>
----

. Export the password from the pull secret:
+
----
export PASSWORD=<the-registry-password>
----

. Copy the pull secret:
+
----
oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' > pull_secret.yaml
----

. Log in using the pull secret:
+
----
oc registry login --registry=${REGISTRY} --auth-basic="$USER:$PASSWORD" --to=pull_secret.yaml
----

. Specify the global hub image pull secret:
+
----
oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull_secret.yaml
----

. Remove the old pull secret:
+
----
rm pull_secret.yaml
----

[#global-hub-installing-disconnected-pull-secret-individual-namespace]
===== Configure the global hub image pull secret to an individual namespace

. Create the secret in the tenant namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc create secret generic <secret_name> -n <tenant_namespace> \
--from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/registry/credentials> \
--type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

. Link the secret to the service account for your operator or operand:
+
----
oc secrets link <operator_sa> -n <tenant_namespace> <secret_name> --for=pull
----
