= Configuring GitOps on managed clusters

You can register a set of one or more {product-title} managed clusters to an instance of Argo CD or {ocp} GitOps operator to deploy applications to those clusters.

[#prerequisites-argo]
== Prerequisites 

* You need to https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd[Install Argo CD] Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator on your {product-title}.

* You need one or more managed cluster.

[#setting-up-managed]
== Setting up managed clusters

* You need to create a placement custom resource to select a set of managed clusters to register to an ArgoCD or {ocp-short} GitOps operator instance. 
//Please refer to THIS DOC for creating a placement. -- we need to point to this when it is ready in issue https://github.com/open-cluster-management/backlog/issues/12767
+
*Note:* If the referenced placement includes Kubernetes clusters other than {ocp-short}, only {ocp-short} clusters are registered to an ArgoCD or OpenShift GitOps operator instance.

* You need to define a set of managed clusters for registration. Refer to the placement documentation. .

[#bind-argo]
== Binding the set of managed clusters 

Bind a _placement rule_ to the cluster with a `GitOpsCluster` custom resource, which registers the set of managed clusters from the placement decision to the specified instance of Argo CD or {ocp} GitOps operator. This enables the ArgoCD instance to deploy applications to any of those {product-title-short} managed clusters. 

+
*Note:* The referenced Placement resource must be in the same namespace as the `GitOpsCluster` resource.

See the following sample `placement:name` is `development-clusters` is specified as target clusters for the GitOps instance that is installed in `argoNamespace:openshift-gitops`. The `argoServer.cluster` specification requires the `local-cluster` value.
