= Configuring GitOps on managed clusters

To configure GitOps, you can register a set of one or more {product-title} managed clusters to an instance of Argo CD or {ocp} GitOps operator to deploy applications to those clusters. Set up a continuous GitOps environment to automate application consistency across clusters in development, staging, and production environments.

[#prerequisites-argo]
== Prerequisites 

* You need to https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd[Install Argo CD] or the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/cicd/gitops[Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator] on your {product-title}.

* You need one or more managed clusters.

[#setting-up-managed]
== Setting up managed clusters

//Please refer to THIS DOC for creating a placement. -- we need to point to this when it is ready in issue https://github.com/open-cluster-management/backlog/issues/12767 (waiting on doc to link here)

. Create a placement custom resource to select a set of managed clusters to register to an ArgoCD or {ocp-short} GitOps operator instance. 

+
*Note:* {ocp-short} clusters are registered to an ArgoCD or OpenShift GitOps operator instance only, not other Kubernetes clusters.

. You need to define a set of managed clusters for registration. 

[#bind-argo]
== Binding the set of managed clusters 

. Bind a _placement rule_ to the cluster with a `GitOpsCluster` custom resource, which registers the set of managed clusters from the _placement decision_ to the specified instance of Argo CD or {ocp} GitOps operator. This enables the ArgoCD instance to deploy applications to any of those {product-title-short} managed clusters. 

+
*Note:* The referenced placement resource must be in the same namespace as the `GitOpsCluster` resource.

+
See from the following sample that `placementRef:name` is `development-clusters` and is specified as target clusters for the GitOps instance that is installed in `argoNamespace:openshift-gitops`. The `argoServer.cluster` specification requires the `local-cluster` value.

+
