[#configuring-ansible]
= Configuring {aap-short} 

{product-title-short} is integrated with {aap} so that you can create prehook and posthook AnsibleJob instances for Git subscription application management. With {aap-short} jobs, you can automate tasks and integrate with external services, such as Slack and PagerDuty services. Your Git repository resource root path will contain `prehook` and `posthook` directories for {aap-short} jobs that run as part of deploying the app, updating the app, or removing the app from a cluster.

[#ansible-configuration]
== Configuring Ansible

You can configure {aap-short} configurations with the following tasks:

[#ansible-secrets]
=== Setting up Ansible secrets

You must create an {aap-short} secret CR in the same subscription namespace. The {aap-short} secret is limited to the same subscription namespace.

Create the secret from the console by filling in the `{aap-short} secret name` section. To create the secret using terminal, edit and apply the following `yaml`:
 
Run the following command to add your YAML file:

----
oc apply -f
----

See the following YAML sample:

*Note:* The `namespace` is the same namespace as the subscription namespace. The `stringData:token` and `host` are from the {aap-short}.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: toweraccess
  namespace: same-as-subscription
type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: ansible-tower-api-token
  host: https://ansible-tower-host-url
----

When the app subscription controller creates prehook and posthook AnsibleJobs, if the secret from subscription `spec.hooksecretref` is available, then it is sent to the AnsibleJob CR `spec.tower_auth_secret` and the AnsibleJob can access the {aap-short}.

[#ansible-secret-reconciliation]
== Seting secret reconciliation

For a main-sub subscription with prehook and posthook AnsibleJobs, the main-sub subscription should be reconciled after all prehook and posthook AnsibleJobs or main subscription are updated in the Git repository. 

Prehook AnsibleJobs and the main subscription continuously reconcile and relaunch a new pre-AnsibleJob instance.

. After the pre-AnsibleJob is done, re-run the main subscription. 
. If there is any specification change in the main subscription, re-deploy the subscription. The main subscription status should be updated to align with the redeployment procedure. 
. Reset the hub subscription status to `nil`. The subscription is refreshed along with the subscription deployment on target clusters. 

+
When the deployment is finished on the target cluster, the subscription status on the target cluster is updated to `"subscribed"` or `"failed"`, and is synced to the hub cluster subscription status.

. After the main subscription is done, relaunch a new post-AnsibleJob instance.

. Verify that the DONE subscription is updated. See the following output:

- subscription.status == `"subscribed"`
- subscription.status == `"propagated"` with all of the target clusters `"subscribed"`

When an AnsibleJob CR is created, A Kubernetes job CR is created to launch an {aap-short} job by communicating to the target {aap-short}. When the job is complete, the final status for the job is returned to AnsibleJob `status.ansibleJobResult`. 

*Notes:* 

The AnsibleJob status.conditions is reserved by the Ansible Job operator for storing the creation of Kubernetes job result. The status.conditions does not reflect the actual {aap-short} job status. 

The subscription controller checks the {aap-short} job status by the `AnsibleJob.status.ansibleJobResult` instead of `AnsibleJob.status.conditions`.

As previously mentioned in the prehook and posthook AnsibleJob workflow, when the main subscription is updated in Git repository, a new prehook and posthook AnsibleJob instance is created. As a result, one main subscription can link to multiple AnsibleJob instances. 

Four fields are defined in subscription.status.ansibleJobs:

- lastPrehookJobs: The most recent prehook AnsibleJobs
- prehookJobsHistory: All the prehook AnsibleJobs history
- lastPosthookJobs: The most recent posthook AnsibleJobs
- posthookJobsHistory: All the posthook AnsibleJobs history


[#ansible-sample-yaml]
== Using Ansible sample YAML files 

See the following sample of an AnsibleJob `.yaml` file in a Git prehook and posthook folder:
