= Deploying ArgoCD with the pull model

The Argo CD server on the hub cluster is responsible for deploying the application resources on the managed
clusters. Pull model implementation applies {ocm} registration, placement, and ManifestWork APIs so that the hub cluster. Secure communication channel between the hub cluster and the managed cluster. With this model, an Argo CD controller must be running on each target managed cluster, then the Argo CD `applicationSet` can use a single manifest to deploy an application on multiple managed clusters. The same `applicationSet` CRD is used to deploy the application to the managed cluster using the push or pull model. 

*Required access:* Cluster administrator

[#pull-model-arch]
== Pull model architecture

To use the pull model, a new annotation `apps.open-cluster-management.io/ocm-managed-cluster` is required in
the template section of the `applicationSet` resource. This annotation is used to specify the target managed cluster for the application. 

- The propagation controller, is added to the hub cluster. This controller watches for applications that contain the
`ocm-managed-cluster` annotation, and creates a manifestWork to deliver the application to the managed cluster.

- On the hub cluster, the ArgoCD application set controller reconciles to create application resources for each target managed cluster.

- Propagation controller on the hub cluster reconciles on the application resources and creates a manifestWork to deliver the application to the managed clusters.

- The ArgoCD application controller on the managed cluster reconciles to
deploy the application.

- Resource sync controller on the hub cluster queries the {ocm} search V2 component on each managed cluster periodically to retrieve the resource list and any error messages for each ArgoCD application.

- Aggregation controller on the hub creates/updates the multicluster
application set report using the data from the resource sync controller
and the status information from the manifestWork for the applications

== Prerequisites 

See the following prerequisites:

- The GitOps operator must be installed on the hub cluster and the target managed clusters. 
- The operator must be installed in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. *Note* Use the OpenShift operator hub to install the GitOps operator, where the default namespace is `openshift-gitops`.
- Every managed cluster must have a cluster secret in the Argo CD server namespace on the hub cluster, application set controller to propagate the ArgoCD application template for a managed cluster.
- Create a GitOps cluster resource that contains a reference to a placement resource since the placement resource selects all the managed clusters that support the pull model. With this prerequisite, the managed cluster secrets are created in the ArgoCD server namespace.

See the following example, where name: `bgdk-app-placement` is a placement can select all clusters:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: GitOpsCluster

    apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
    name: bgdk-app-placement      
    namespace: openshift-gitops
----

*Information:* If the `openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller` service account is not a cluster administrator, the gitops application controller might not have the required permission to deploy resources. The application status might send an error similar to the following error:

----
cannot create resource "services" in API group "" in the namespace
"mortgage",deployments.apps is forbidden: User
"system:serviceaccount:openshift-gitops:openshift-gitops-argocd-application-controller"
----

To avoid this issue, see the following procedure:

. Create all namespaces on each managed cluster where the ArgoCD
application will be deployed.

. Add the `manage-by` label to each namespace. If an ArgoCD application is deployed to multiple namespaces,
each namespace should be managed by ArgoCD.

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: mortgage2

. Explicitly declare all application destination namespaces in the repository for the application and include the `managed-by` label in the namespaces. Refer to _Additional resources_ to learn how to declare a namespace.

For deploying applications using the pull model, it is important for the
ArgoCD application controllers to ignore these application resources on
the hub cluster. The desired solution is to add the
_argocd.argoproj.io/skip-reconcile_ annotation to the template section
of the applicationSet. On the ACM hub cluster, the required OpenShift
GitOps operator must be version 1.9.0 or above. On the managed
cluster(s), the OpenShift GitOps operator is recommended to be at the
same level as the hub cluster.
____

____
[line-through]*If youâ€™re OpenShift GitOps operator version lower than
1.9.0, which does not have support for the _skip-reconcile_ annotation,
the workaround is to disable the ArgoCD application controller running
on the hub cluster. In the example below, the image in the deployment
for the GitOps application controller is set to an invalid value.*

=== *ApplicationSet CRD*

The ArgoCD ApplicationSet CRD is used to deploy applications on the
managed clusters using the push or pull model. It uses a placement
resource in the generator field to get a list of managed clusters. The
template field supports parameter substitution of specifications for the
application. The ArgoCD applicationSet controller on the hub cluster
manages the creation of the application for each target cluster.

For the pull model, the destination for the application must be the
default local kubernetes server
(https://kubernetes.default.svc/[[.underline]#https://kubernetes.default.svc#])
since the application will be deployed locally by the application
controller on the managed cluster. By default, the push model is used to
deploy the application, unless the annotations
_apps.open-cluster-management.io/ocm-managed-cluster_ and
_apps.open-cluster-management.io/pull-to-ocm-managed-cluster_ are added
to the template section of the applicationSet.

The following is a sample ApplicationSet YAML that uses the pull model:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1

=== *Propagation controller*

There are two sets of controllers on the hub cluster watching the
applicationSet resources: Argo CD application controllers and the new
propagation controller. Annotations in the application resource is used
to determine which controller reconciles to deploy the application. The
ArgoCD application controllers, which are used for the push model,
ignore applications that contain the _argocd.argoproj.io/skip-reconcile_
annotation. The propagation controller, which supports the pull model,
only reconciles on applications that contain the
_apps.open-cluster-management.io/ocm-managed-cluster_ annotation. It
generates a manifestWork to deliver the application to the managed
cluster. The managed cluster is determined by the value of the
_ocm-managed-cluster_ annotation.

The following is a sample manifestWork YAML that is generated by the
propagation controller to create the guestbook application on the
managed cluster _pcluster2_:

apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1

kind: ManifestWork

project: default

source:

path: guestbook

repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git

syncPolicy:

automated: \{}

syncOptions:

- CreateNamespace=true

As a result of the feedback rules specified in manifestConfigs, the
health status and the sync status from the status of the ArgoCD
application are synced to the manifestworkâ€™s statusFeedback.

=== *Deploy application by the local ArgoCD server on the managed cluster*

After the ArgoCD application is created on the managed cluster through
ManifestWorks, the local ArgoCD controllers reconcile to deploy the
application. The controllers deploy the application through this
sequence of operations:

* {blank}
+
____
Connect and pull resources from the specified Git/Helm repository
____
* {blank}
+
____
Deploy the resources on the local managed cluster
____
* {blank}
+
____
Generate the ArgoCD application status
____

=== *Multicluster Application report - aggregate application status from the managed clusters* 

A new multicluster applicationSet report CRD is introduced to provide an
aggregate status of the applicationSet on the hub. The report is only
created for applicationSets that are deployed using the new pull model.
It includes the list of resources and the overall status of the
application from each managed cluster. A separate multicluster
applicationSet report resource is created for each ArgoCD applicationSet
resource. The report is created in the same namespace as the
applicationSet. The Multicluster ApplicationSet report includes:

* {blank}
+
____
List of resources for the ArgoCD application
____
* {blank}
+
____
Overall sync and health status for one ArgoCD application
____
* {blank}
+
____
Includes error message for each cluster where the overall status is out
of sync or unhealthy
____
* {blank}
+
____
Summary status of the overall application status from all the managed
clusters
____

To support the generation of the multicluster applicationSet report, two
new controllers have been added to the hub cluster: the resource sync
controller and the aggregation controller. The resource sync controller
runs every 10 seconds, and its purpose is to query the OCM search V2
component on each managed cluster to retrieve the resource list and any
error messages for each ArgoCD application. It then produces an
intermediate report for each application set, which is intended to be
used by the aggregation controller to generate the final multicluster
applicationSet report.

The aggregation controller also runs every 10 seconds, and it uses the
report generated by the resource sync controller to add the health and
sync status of the application on each managed cluster. The status for
each application is retrieved from the status feedback in the
manifestwork for the application. Once the aggregation is complete, the
final multicluster applicationSet report is saved in the same namespace
as the ArgoCD applicationSet, with the same name as the applicationSet.

The two new controllers, along with the propagation controller, all run
in separate containers in the same _multicluster-integrations_ pod, as
shown in the example below:

NAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS

open-cluster-management multicluster-integrations-7c46498d9-fqbq4 3/3

All the resources listed in the multicluster applicationSet report are
actually deployed on the managed cluster(s). If a resource fails to be
deployed, the resource won't be included in the resource list. However,
the error message would indicate why the resource failed to be deployed.

=== *Limitations*

[arabic]
. {blank}
+
____
It is possible that both the ArgoCD controller and the propagation
controller will both reconcile on the same application resource. This
will cause the duplicate instances of application to be deployed on the
managed clusters, from the different deployment models.
____

____
For deploying applications using the pull model, it is important for the
ArgoCD controllers to ignore these application resources. The desired
solution is to add the _argocd.argoproj.io/skip-reconcile_ annotation to
the template section of the applicationSet. However, this annotation is
only available in OpenShift GitOps operator version 1.9.0 or higher. To
prevent conflicts, it is recommended to wait until the ACM hub and all
the managed clusters are upgraded to OpenShift GitOps operator version
1.9.0 before using the pull model.

[line-through]*If youâ€™re OpenShift GitOps operator version lower than
1.9.0, which does not have support for the _skip-reconcile_ annotation,
the workaround is to disable the ArgoCD application controller running
on the hub cluster. In the example below, the image in the deployment
for the GitOps application controller is set to an invalid value.*

____
[line-through]*However, until OpenShift GitOps operator version 1.9.0 is
installed, users should only use one model for deploying the application
sets (push or pull). If users already have application sets that were
deployed using the push model, it is not recommended to disable the
GitOps application controller on the hub in order to use the pull model,
as this would prevent updates to their existing applications. If the
user wishes to switch back to the push model after trying the pull
model, the user should remove all the application sets before
re-enabling the GitOps application controller.*
