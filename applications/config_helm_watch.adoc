Configuring Helm application to watch namespace scoped resources

By default, when a subscription deploys subscribed Helm applications to target clusters, the application resources are not being watched. 

Required access: Cluster administrator

To configure the Helm application to watch namespace scoped resources, set the value for the `watchHelmNamespaceScopedResources` field in your subscription definition to `true`.

See the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: ns-sub-1
spec:
  watchHelmNamespaceScopedResources: true
  channel: ns-ch/predev-ch
  name: nginx-ingress
  packageFilter:
    version: "1.36.x"
