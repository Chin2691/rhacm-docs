[#config_leader_election]
= Configuring leader election

You can reduce your etcd load by configuring `leaseDuration`, `renewDeadline`, or `retryPeriod` of controllers.


[#controller-change]
== Editing the controller

When you configure leader election, you receive the following default values:

- leaseDuration:  137 seconds
- renewDeadline: 107 seconds
- retryPeriod: 26 seconds

See the following steps to set the `multicluster-operators-application`, `multicluster-operators-channel`, `multicluster-operators-standalone-subscription`, or `multicluster-operators-hub-subscription` controllers:

. Run `oc get csv -n open-cluster-management` to get and edit the {product-title-short} `csv` file. Use the `advanced-cluster-management` name, for example. The command resembles `oc edit csv -n open-cluster-management advanced-cluster-management.v2.7.0`.

. Locate and specify a controller and insert a `- command:`  for a flag with a specified time in seconds. Search `name: <controller>`, for example: `name: multicluster-operators-hub-subscription`

. Save the file. The controller restarts to apply the flag. 

. Repeat this procedure for each controller that you want to change.

See the following example output of a successful flag:
