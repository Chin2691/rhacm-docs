= Managing apps with Object storage repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from Object storage repositories in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. You can only perform actions that your role is assigned. Learn about access requirements from the link:../access_control/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.

[#deploy-resource-object-storage]
== Deploy resources from object storage

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from object storage Git repositories in the following procedure.

. From the console navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.

. Click *Create application*.

+
For the following steps, select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create your application. See YAML samples later in the topic.

. Enter the following values in the correct fields:
+
* Name: Enter a valid Kubernetes name for the application.
* Namespace: Select a namespace from the list. You can also create a namespace by using a valid Kubernetes name if you are assigned the correct access role.
 
. Choose *Object storage* from the list of repositories that you can use.

. Enter the required URL path or select an existing path.

+
If you select an existing Object storage repository path, you do not need to specify connection information if this is a private repository. The connection information is pre-set and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Object storage repository path, you can optionally enter Object storage connection information if this is a private Object storage repository.

. Enter values for the optional fields. Optional fields are defined in the fields or in the hover text.
 
. Set any optional pre and post-deployment tasks. 
 
. From _Select clusters to deploy_, you can update the placement rule information for your application. Choose from the following:

+
- Deploy on local cluster

- Deploy to all online clusters and local cluster

- Deploy application resources only on clusters matching specified labels

- You have the option to _Select existing placement configuration_ if you create an application in an existing namespace with placement rules already defined.
 
. From _Settings_, you can specify application behavior. To block or activate changes to your deployment during a specific time window, choose an option for _Deployment window_ and your _Time window configuration_.

. You can either choose another repository or Click *Save*.

. You are redirected to the _Overview_ page where you can view the details and topology.

[#sample-yaml-object]
== Sample YAML

The following example channel definition abstracts an object storage as a channel:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
 name: dev
 namespace: ch-obj
spec:
 type: Object storage
 pathname: [http://9.28.236.243:31311/dev] # URL is appended with the valid bucket name, which matches the channel name.
 secretRef:
   name: miniosecret
 gates:
   annotations:
     dev-ready: true

[#creating-aws-object-bucket]
= Creating your Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 object bucket.

In ACM 2.3, user is able to create ACM subscriptions to subscribe resources defined in a AWS S3 object bucket. In order to do this

###  Create your AWS S3 object bucket.

1. log into the AWS console using your AWS account, user name, and password 
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/

2.  Navigate to `Amazon S3 -> buckets` in the upper left section  to go to the bucket home page, then click on  `Create Bucket` to create your bucket 

Note the `AWS region` can be selected when the bucket is created, which is essential for connecting your AWS S3 object bucket.

3.  Create the bucket access token
- Navigate to your user name in the upper right section of the navigation bar. From the drop-down menu, select `My Security Credentials` 
- Go to `Access keys for CLI, SDK, & API access` in the `AWS IAM credentials` tab,  click on`Create access key`
- Save your `Access key ID` ,`Secret access key` 
 
4. upload your object yaml files to the bucket

###  Create the ACM subscription to subscribe object in the AWS bucket
1.  Create a object bucket type channel with a secret to specify the `AccessKeyID`, `SecretAccessKey` and `Region` for connecting the AWS bucket. The three fields are created when the AWS bucket is created.

Note the AWS S3 object bucket URL is not necessary for connecting the bucket via AWS S3 api.  But we are using the URL to identify the channel is a AWS S3 bucket if the URL contains `s3://` or `s3 and aws` keywords. e.g. All of the following bucket URLs will be regarded as a AWS s3 bucket.
```
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/xili-bucket-1
s3://xili-bucket-1/
https://xili-bucket-1.s3.amazonaws.com/
```

Here is a complete AWS S3 object bucket channel sample yaml
```
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: object-dev
  namespace: ch-object-dev
spec:
  type: ObjectBucket
  pathname: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/xili-bucket-1
  secretRef:
    name: secret-dev
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-dev
  namespace: ch-object-dev
stringData:
  AccessKeyID: <your AWS bucket access key id>
  SecretAccessKey: <your AWS bucket secret access key>
  Region: <your AWS  bucket region>
type: Opaque
```
2. Create other ACM subscription, placementrule objects as usual
